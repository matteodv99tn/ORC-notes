# Advanced Optimization-Based Robot Control

This repository contains the personal notes I took while attending the course _Advanced Optimization-Based Robot Control_ held by professor [Andrea Del Prete](https://webapps.unitn.it/du/it/Persona/PER0197808/Didattica), academic year 2022-2023.

This [pdf](notes.pdf) contains almost all topics covered in the course. Still few things are not completely rewritten in latex and are currently missing (you might see some notes written in italian with `todo` in bold).
