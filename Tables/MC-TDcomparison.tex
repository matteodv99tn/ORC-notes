		must wait until the end of an episode to know the cost & can learn after every step \\
		only works with episodic (terminating) environments & works also in non-terminating environment \\ 
		the cost-to-go $\mathcal J_t$ is an unbiased estimate of $V^\pi(x_t)$ & target is a biased estimate of $V^\pi(x_t)$
