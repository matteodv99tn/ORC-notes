abstract = {To evaluate the central tendency we plotted the reproduced lengths against the presented length and measured the regression index, defined as the difference in slope between the best linear fit of the data and the identity line. This index varies from 0 (veridical performance) to 1 (complete regression to the mean). In the control 'alone' conditions, all subjects showed on average a clear central tendency mechanism (average regression index 0.417±0.028) which decreased significantly when the task was performed with the robot (0.156±0.028, one-tailed, pair-sample t-test, p < 0.01). Part of this common decrease can be explained by the difference in the richness of the two kinds of stimuli: on the one hand just two brief flashes of lights represented the length to be reproduced, while in both robotics conditions the whole arm motion was visible, providing a richer stimulation. Indeed, according to the Bayesian models described in [1,4] the presence of less sensory noise would yield to less regression to the mean. However, the amount of change in regression was different between the two robotic groups. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. The upcoming generation of humanoid robots will have to be equipped with state-of-The-Art technical features along with high industrial quality, but they should also offer the prospect of effective physical human interaction. In this paper we introduce a new humanoid robot capable of interacting with a human environment and targeting industrial applications. Limitations are outlined and used together with the feedback from the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and other teams leading the field in creating new humanoid robots. The resulting robot is able to handle weights of 6 kg with an out-stretched arm, and has powerful motors to carry out fast movements. Its kinematics have been specially designed for screwing and drilling motions. In order to make interaction with human operators possible, this robot is equipped with torque sensors to measure joint effort and high resolution encoders to measure both motor and joint positions. The humanoid robotics field has reached a stage where robustness and repeatability is the next watershed. We believe that this robot has the potential to become a powerful tool for the research community to successfully navigate this turning point, as the humanoid robot HRP-2 was in its own time.},

We present a novel method for synthesizing collision-free, dynamic locomotion behaviors for legged robots, including jumping, going down a very steep slope, or recovering from a push using the arms of the robot. The approach is automatic and generic: non-gaited motions, comprising arbitrary contact postures can be generated along any environment. At the core of our framework is a new steering method that generates trajectories connecting two states of the robot. These trajectories account for the state-dependent, centroidal dynamic constraints inherent to legged robots. The method, of low dimension, formulated as a Linear Program, is really efficient to compute, and can find an application in various problems related to legged locomotion. By incorporating this steering method into an existing sampling-based contact planner, we propose the first kinodynamic contact planner for legged robots.},

abstract = {This paper introduces and evaluates a family of new simple estimators to reconstruct the pose and velocity of the floating base. The estimation of the floating-base state is a critical challenge to whole-body control methods that rely on full-state information in high-rate feedback. Although the kinematics of grounded limbs may be used to estimate the pose and velocity of the body, modelling errors from ground irregularity, foot slip, and structural flexibilities limit the utility of estimation from kinematics alone. These difficulties have motivated the development of sensor fusion methods to augment body-mounted IMUs with kinematic measurements. Existing methods often rely on extended Kalman filtering, which lack convergence guarantees and may present difficulties in tuning. This paper proposes two new simplifications to the floating-base state estimation problem that make use of robust off-the-shelf orientation estimators to bootstrap development. Experiments for in-place balance and walking with the HRP-2 show that the simplifications yield results on par with the accuracy reported in the literature for other methods. As further benefits, the structure of the proposed estimators prevents divergence of the estimates, simplifies tuning, and admits efficient computation. These benefits are envisioned to help accelerate the development of baseline estimators in future humanoids.},

abstract = {Predictive control is an efficient model-based methodology to control complex dynamical systems. In general, it boils down to the resolution at each control cycle of a large nonlinear optimization problem. A critical issue is then to provide a good guess to initialize the nonlinear solver so as to speed up convergence. This is particularly important when disturbances or changes in the environment prevent the use of the trajectory computed at the previous control cycle as initial guess. In this paper, we introduce an original and very efficient solution to automatically build this initial guess. We propose to rely on off-line computation to build an approximation of the optimal trajectories, that can be used on-line to initialize the predictive controller. To that end, we combined the use of sampling-based planning, policy learning with generic representations (such as neural networks), and direct optimal control. We first propose an algorithm to simultaneously build a kinodynamic probabilistic roadmap (PRM) and approximate value function and control policy. This algorithm quickly converges toward an approximation of the optimal state-control trajectories (along with an optimal PRM). Then, we propose two methods to store the optimal trajectories and use them to initialize the predictive controller. We experimentally show that directly storing the state-control trajectories leads the predictive controller to quickly converges (2 to 5 iterations) toward the (global) optimal solution. The results are validated in simulation with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and other dynamical systems.},

abstract = {We present a framework capable of producing contact plans describing complex multiped motions (including humanoid): standing up, climbing stairs using a handrail, crossing rubble and getting out of a car. Our framework answers a need demonstrated at the Darpa Robotics Challenge, where the lack of an automatic acyclic contact planner was recognized a major issue. Our novel key idea is the reachability condition. Informally, it verifies that the root configuration of a robot is “close, but not too close” from obstacles: close to allow contact creation, not too close to avoid collision. With this approximation of the space of admissible root configurations we decompose the hard contact planning problem into simpler sub-problems: first, to plan a guide path for the root without considering the whole-body configuration; then, to generate a discrete sequence of whole-body configurations in static equilibrium along this path. The reachability condition turns the high-dimensional computation of the guide into a collision checking problem, solved in less than a few seconds. Then a deterministic contact selection algorithm tackles the combinatorial issue of generating of a discrete sequence along the guide path. Several innovations make it computationally efficient: a criterion for verifying static equilibrium, and a set of heuristics used to enforce desirable properties on the configuration. Our approach results from the pragmatic choice of favoring efficiency over exhaustiveness, justified empirically: in a few seconds, with satisfying success rates, we generate complex contact plans for various scenarios and robots, namely HRP-2, HyQ, and a dexterous hand.},

abstract = {Recently, the centroidal momentum dynamics has received substantial attention to plan dynamically consistent motions for robots with arms and legs in multi-contact scenarios. However, it is also non convex which renders any optimization approach difficult and timing is usually kept fixed in most trajectory optimization techniques to not introduce additional non convexities to the problem. But this can limit the versatility of the algorithms. In our previous work, we proposed a convex relaxation of the problem that allowed to efficiently compute momentum trajectories and contact forces. However, our approach could not minimize a desired angular momentum objective which seriously limited its applicability. Noticing that the non-convexity introduced by the time variables is of similar nature as the centroidal dynamics one, we propose two convex relaxations to the problem based on trust regions and soft constraints. The resulting approaches can compute time-optimized dynamically consistent trajectories sufficiently fast to make the approach realtime capable. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in several multi-contact scenarios for a humanoid robot. In particular, we show that the proposed convex relaxation of the original problem finds solutions that are consistent with the original non-convex problem and illustrate how timing optimization allows to find motion plans that would be difficult to plan with fixed timing.},

abstract = {Fig. 1. Multi contact motions synthesized by our method. Synthesizing motions for legged characters in arbitrary environments is a long-standing problem that has recently received a lot of attention from the computer graphics community. We tackle this problem with a procedural approach that is generic, fully automatic and independent from motion capture data. The main contribution of this paper is a point-mass-model-based method to synthesize Center Of Mass trajectories. These trajectories are then used to generate the whole-body motion of the character. The use of a point mass model often results in physically inconsistent motions and joint limit violations. We mitigate these issues through the use of a novel formulation of the kinematic constraints which allows us to generate a quasi-static Center Of Mass trajectory, in a way that is both user-friendly and computationally efficient. We also show that the quasi-static constraint can be relaxed to generate motions usable for applications of computer graphics (on average 83% of a given trajectory remain physically consistent). Our method was integrated in our open-source contact planner and tested with different scenarios -some never addressed before-featuring legged characters performing non-gaited motions in cluttered environments. The computational efficiency of our trajectory generation algorithm (under ten ms to compute one second of motion) enables us to synthesize motions in a few seconds, one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {The ability to anticipate a fall is fundamental for any robot that has to balance. Currently, fast fall-prediction algorithms only exist for simple models, such as the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), whose validity breaks down in multi-contact scenarios (i.e. when contacts are not limited to a flat ground). This paper presents a fast fall-prediction algorithm based on the point-mass model, which remains valid in multi-contact scenarios. The key assumption of our algorithm is that, in order to come to a stop without changing its contacts, a robot only needs to accelerate its center of mass in the direction opposite to its velocity. This assumption allows us to predict the fall by means of a convex optimal control problem, which we solve with a fast custom algorithm (less than 10 ms of computation time). We validated the approach through extensive simulations with the humanoid robot HRP-2 in randomly-sampled scenarios. Comparisons with standard LIPM-based methods demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in predicting the fall of the robot, when controlled with a state-of-the-art balance controller. This work lays the foundations for the solution of the challenging problem of push recovery in multi-contact scenarios.},

abstract = {Trajectory optimization (TO) is one of the most powerful tools for generating feasible motions for humanoid robots. However, including uncertainties and stochasticity in the TO problem to generate robust motions can easily lead to intractable problems. Furthermore, since the models used in TO have always some level of abstraction, it can be hard to find a realistic set of uncertainties in the model space. In this paper we leverage a sample-efficient learning technique (Bayesian optimization) to robustify TO for humanoid locomotion. The main idea is to use data from full-body simulations to make the TO stage robust by tuning the cost weights. To this end, we split the TO problem into two phases. The first phase solves a convex optimization problem for generating center of mass (CoM) trajectories based on simplified linear dynamics. The second stage employs iterative Linear-Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) as a whole-body controller to generate full body control inputs. Then we use Bayesian optimization to find the cost weights to use in the first stage that yields robust performance in the simulation/experiment, in the presence of different disturbance/uncertainties. The results show that the proposed approach is able to generate robust motions for different sets of disturbances and uncertainties.},

abstract = {Versatility is one of the main factors driving the adoption of robots on the assembly line and in other applications. Compared to fixed-automation solutions, a single industrial robot can perform a wide range of tasks (e.g., welding, lifting). In other platforms, such as legged robots, versatility is a necessity to negotiate varied terrains. The ability to balance performance across these anticipated scenarios is one of the main challenges to the process of design. To address this challenge, this letter proposes a new framework for the computational design of versatile robots by considering the interplay between mechanical design and control across multiple tasks and environments. The proposed method optimizes morphology parameters while simultaneously adjusting control parameters using trajectory optimization (TO) so that a single design can fulfill multiple tasks. As its main contribution, the letter details an approach to combine methods from stochastic programming (SP) with TO to address the scalability of these multi-task co-design problems. To assess the effects of this contribution, this letter considers the problems of designing a planar manipulator to transport a range of loads and a hopping monopod robot that must jump across a variety of terrains. The proposed formulation achieves faster solution times and improved scalability in comparison to state of the art co-design solutions. The resulting designs are also shown to be more versatile in terms of providing improved energy cost and task completion times across multiple scenarios.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges of planning legged locomotion in complex environments is the combinatorial contact selection problem. Recent contributions propose to use integer variables to represent which contact surface is selected, and then to rely on modern mixed-integer (MI) optimization solvers to handle this combinatorial issue. To reduce the computational cost of MI, we exploit the sparsity properties of L1 norm minimization techniques to relax the contact planning problem into a feasibility linear program. Our approach accounts for kinematic reachability of the center of mass (COM) and of the contact effectors. We ensure the existence of a quasi-static COM trajectory by restricting our plan to quasi-flat contacts. For planning 10 steps with less than 10 potential contact surfaces for each phase, our approach is 50 to 100 times faster that its MI counterpart, which suggests potential applications for online contact re-planning. The method is demonstrated in simulation with the humanoid robots HRP-2 and Talos over various scenarios.},

abstract = {This article proposes a new framework for the computational design of robots that are robust to disturbances. The framework combines trajectory optimization (TO) and feedback control design to produce robots with improved performance under perturbations by co-optimizing a nominal trajectory alongside a feedback policy and the system morphology. Stochastic programming (SP) methods are used to address these perturbations via uncertainty models in the problem specification, resulting in motions that are easier to stabilize via feedback. Two robotic systems serve to demonstrate the potential of the method: a planar manipulator and a jumping monopod robot. The co-optimized robots achieve higher performance compared to state-of-the-art solutions where the feedback controller is designed separately from the physical system. Specifically, the co-designed controllers show higher tracking accuracy and improved energy efficiency (e.g., 91% decrease in tracking error and ≈5% decrease in energy consumption for a manipulator) compared to linear quadratic regulator applied to a design optimized for nominal conditions.},

abstract = {One challenge of legged locomotion on uneven terrains is to deal with both the discrete problem of selecting a contact surface for each footstep and the continuous problem of placing each footstep on the selected surface. Consequently, footstep planning can be addressed with a Mixed Integer Program (MIP), an elegant but computationally demanding method, which can make it unsuitable for online planning. We reformulate the MIP into a cardinality problem, then approximate it as a computationally efficient ell 1-norm minimisation, called SL1M. Moreover, we improve the performance and convergence of SL1M by combining it with a sampling-based root trajectory planner to prune irrelevant surface candidates. Our tests on the humanoid Talos in four representative scenarios show that SL1M always converges faster than MIP. For scenarios when the combinatorial complexity is small (< 10 surfaces per step), SL1M converges at least two times faster than MIP with no need for pruning. In more complex cases, SL1M converges up to 100 times faster than MIP with the help of pruning. Moreover, pruning can also improve the MIP computation time. The versatility of the framework is shown with additional tests on the quadruped robot ANYmal.},

abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) has shown great success for controlling complex systems such as legged robots. However, when closing the loop, the performance and feasibility of the finite horizon optimal control problem solved at each control cycle is not guaranteed anymore. This is due to model discrepancies, the effect of low-level controllers, uncertainties and sensor noise. To address these issues, we propose a modified version of a standard MPC approach used in legged locomotion with viability (weak forward invariance) guarantees that ensures the feasibility of the optimal control problem. Moreover, we use past experimental data to find the best cost weights, which measure a combination of performance, constraint satisfaction robustness, or stability (invariance). These interpretable costs measure the trade off between robustness and performance. For this purpose, we use Bayesian optimization (BO) to systematically design experiments that help efficiently collect data to learn a cost function leading to robust performance. Our simulation results with different realistic disturbances (i.e. external pushes, unmodeled actuator dynamics and computational delay) show the effectiveness of our approach to create robust controllers for humanoid robots.},

The goal of this survey is to cover the recent progress toward these applications that has been driven by model-based optimization for the real-time generation and control of movement. The majority of the research community has converged on the idea of generating locomotion control laws by solving an optimal control problem (OCP) in either a model-based or data-driven manner. However, solving the most general of these problems online remains intractable due to complexities from intermittent unidirectional contacts with the environment, and from the many degrees of freedom of legged robots. This survey covers methods that have been pursued to make these OCPs computationally tractable, with specific focus on how environmental contacts are treated, how the model can be simplified, and how these choices affect the numerical solution methods employed. The survey focuses on model-based optimization, covering its recent use in a stand alone fashion, and suggesting avenues for combination with learning-based formulations to further accelerate progress in this growing field.},

abstract = {This letter presents a novel algorithm for the continuous control of dynamical systems that combines Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a single framework. The motivations behind this algorithm are the two main limitations of TO and RL when applied to continuous nonlinear systems to minimize a non-convex cost function. Specifically, TO can get stuck in poor local minima when the search is not initialized close to a 'good' minimum. On the other hand, when dealing with continuous state and control spaces, the RL training process may be excessively long and strongly dependent on the exploration strategy. Thus, our algorithm learns a 'good' control policy via TO-guided RL policy search that, when used as initial guess provider for TO, makes the trajectory optimization process less prone to converge to poor local optima. Our method is validated on several reaching problems featuring non-convex obstacle avoidance with different dynamical systems, including a car model with 6D state, and a 3-joint planar manipulator. Our results show the great capabilities of CACTO in escaping local minima, while being more computationally efficient than the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) RL algorithms.},

abstract = {For legged robots, aerial motions are the only option to overpass obstacles that cannot be circumvent with standard locomotion gaits. In these cases, the robot must perform a leap to either jump onto the obstacle or fly over it. However, these movements represent a challenge because during the flight phase the \gls{com} cannot be controlled, and the robot orientation has limited controllability. This paper focuses on the latter issue and proposes an \gls{ocs} consisting of two rotating and actuated masses (flywheels or reaction wheels) to gain control authority on the robot orientation. Because of the conservation of angular momentum, their rotational velocity can be adjusted to steer the robot orientation even when there are no contacts with the ground. The axes of rotation of the flywheels are designed to be incident, leading to a compact orientation control system that is capable of controlling both roll and pitch angles, considering the different moment of inertia in the two directions. We tested the concept with simulations on the robot Solo12.},

Balancing a matrix reduces the norm of the matrix and hopefully this will improve the accuracy of the computation. Experiments have shown that balancing can improve the accuracy of the computed eigenval- ues. However, there exists examples where balancing increases the eigenvalue condition number (potential loss in accuracy), deteriorates eigenvector accuracy, and deteriorates the backward error of the eigenvalue decomposition. In this paper we propose a change to the stopping criteria of the LAPACK balancing al- gorithm, GEBAL. The new stopping criteria is better at determining when a matrix is nearly balanced. Our experiments show that the new algorithm is able to maintain good backward error, while improving the eigenvalue accuracy when possible.

These models can be easily composed to express the co-design constraints among different subsystems. The user then queries the model, to obtain the design with minimal resources usage, subject to a lower bound on the provided functionality. This paper concerns the introduction of uncertainty in the framework. Uncertainty has two roles: first, it allows to deal with limited knowledge of the models; second, it also can be used to generate consistent relaxations of a problem, as the computation requirements can be lowered, should the user accept some uncertainty in the answer.},

abstract = {This letter presents a passivity-based inverse dynamics (ID) controller using a global energy tank. The proposed control approach allows us to achieve a safe multi-contact scenario on a torque controlled humanoid robot. The controller is primarily a task space ID quadratic programming (QP) which efficiently computes the reference torque satisfying a non-hierarchical set of tasks. Our work extends this controller by adding a global energy tank modulating the task gains, with power regulation, to ensure the passivity of the system. This method combines the benefits of the ID controller, which computes an optimal reference without joint torque feedback, and of the passivity-based system, which is robust to model uncertainties and external disturbances. The robustness of our framework is demonstrated in Gazebo simulations, where the robot TALOS achieves a multi-contact scenario and a 20 cm step walk, with objectives in the Cartesian and configuration spaces, in torque control. The implementation of this controller is open-source.},

abstract = {Contact constraints arise naturally in many robot planning problems. In recent years, a variety of contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithms have been developed that avoid the pitfalls of mode pre-specification by simultaneously optimizing state, input, and contact force trajectories. However, their reliance on first-order integrators leads to a linear tradeoff between optimization problem size and plan accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a new family of trajectory optimization algorithms that leverage ideas from discrete variational mechanics to derive higher-order generalizations of the classic time-stepping method of Stewart and Trinkle. By using these dynamics formulations as constraints in direct trajectory optimization algorithms, it is possible to perform contact-implicit trajectory optimization with significantly higher accuracy. For concreteness, we derive a second-order method and evaluate it using several simulated rigid-body systems, including an underactuated biped and a quadruped. In addition, we use this second-order method to plan locomotion trajectories for a complex quadrupedal microrobot. The planned trajectories are evaluated on the physical platform and result in a number of performance improvements.},

The leg design parameters (e.g. link lengths, transmission ratios, and spring parameters) are optimized for a user-deﬁned metric such as the minimization of energy consumption or actuator peak torque, enabling the user to better navigate through the high-dimensional and unintuitive design space. Our approach uses the single rigid body dynamics trajectory optimization tool TOWR to generate realistic motion plans. The planned predeﬁned forces and motions are then used to identify actuator velocities and torques. Next, the leg design parameters are optimized using a genetic algorithm. The framework was validated by comparison with measured data on the ANYmal quadruped robot for a trotting motion, with errors in cumulative joint torque and mechanical energy each below 8% per gait cycle. Optimization of the ANYmal link lengths demonstrate that reductions in joint torque, mechanical energy, and mechanical cost of transport in the range of 5-10% are attainable.},

abstract = {Legged robots pose one of the greatest challenges in robotics. Dynamic and agile maneuvers of animals cannot be imitated by existing methods that are crafted by humans. A compelling alternative is reinforcement learning, which requires minimal craftsmanship and promotes the natural evolution of a control policy. However, so far, reinforcement learning research for legged robots is mainly limited to simulation, and only few and comparably simple examples have been deployed on real systems. The primary reason is that training with real robots, particularly with dynamically balancing systems, is complicated and expensive. In the present work, we introduce a method for training a neural network policy in simulation and transferring it to a state-of-the-art legged system, thereby leveraging fast, automated, and cost-effective data generation schemes. The approach is applied to the ANYmal robot, a sophisticated medium-dog-sized quadrupedal system. Using policies trained in simulation, the quadrupedal machine achieves locomotion skills that go beyond what had been achieved with prior methods: ANYmal is capable of precisely and energy-efficiently following high-level body velocity commands, running faster than before, and recovering from falling even in complex configurations.},

It is shown through dynamics simulations that the magnitude of the net rotation is dependent upon the amplitude of the angular displacement of the joints. With realistic joint limitations, the robot, which includes rotary actuators only, can perform a 180◦ reorientation about its longitudinal axis, similar to the cat righting reflex. The second manoeuvre allows the robot to accomplish rotations of smaller magnitude about a different axis. A physical prototype and a VICON motion tracking system are used to experimentally validate the simulation results. Finally, it is shown that the two manoeuvres, which yield rotations about fixed axes, can be repeated and alternated to enable the robot to reach any arbitrary 3-D orientation.},

We show that determining such gaits is possible without the need to specify a good initial motion, and without manually restricting the allowed gaits of each animal. Our approach is based on a hybrid optimization method which combines an efficient derivative-aware spacetime constraints optimization with a derivative-free approach able to find non-local solutions in high-dimensional discontinuous spaces.

abstract = {For many applications of reinforcement learning it can be more convenient to specify both a reward function and constraints, rather than trying to design behavior through the reward function. For example, systems that physically interact with or around humans should satisfy safety constraints. Recent advances in policy search algorithms (Mnih et al., 2016; Schulman et al., 2015; Lillicrap et al., 2016; Levine et al., 2016) have enabled new capabilities in high-dimensional control, but do not consider the constrained setting. We propose Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO), the first generalpurpose policy search algorithm for constrained reinforcement learning with guarantees for nearconstraint satisfaction at each iteration. Our method allows us to train neural network policies for high-dimensional control while making guarantees about policy behavior all throughout training. Our guarantees are based on a new theoretical result, which is of independent interest: we prove a bound relating the expected returns of two policies to an average divergence between them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated robot locomotion tasks where the agent must satisfy constraints motivated by safety.},

The method is based on the robust control of contact forces in order to track a planned Center of Mass trajectory. Its appeal lies in the ability to guarantee robust stability and performance despite rigid body model mismatch, actuator dynamics, delays, contact surface stiffness, and unobserved ground profiles. Furthermore, we introduce a task space decomposition approach which removes the coupling effects between contact force controller and the other non-contact controllers. Finally, we verify our control performance on a quadruped robot and compare its performance to a standard inverse dynamics approach on hardware.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel control scheme, named self-reflective model predictive control, which takes its own limitations in the presence of process noise and measurement errors into account. In contrast to existing output-feedback MPC and persistently exciting MPC controllers, the proposed self-reflective MPC controller does not only propagate a matrix-valued state forward in time in order to predict the variance of future state-estimates, but it also propagates a matrix-valued adjoint state backward in time. This adjoint state is used by the controller to compute and minimize a second order approximation of its own expected loss of control performance in the presence of random process noise and inexact state estimates. The properties of the proposed controller are illustrated with a small but non-trivial case study.},

A robot with a flat paddle is required to strike repeatedly at a thrown ball until the ball is brought to rest on the paddle at a specified location. The robot's reachable workspace is blocked by an obstacle that disconnects the free space formed when the ball and paddle remain in contact, forcing the machine to `let go' for a time to bring the ball to the desired state. The controller compositions we create guarantee that a ball introduced in the `safe workspace' remains there and is ultimately brought to the goal.

@phdthesis{Smaldone2022,
abstract = {We present a real time algorithm for humanoid 3D walking and/or running based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach. The objective is to generate a stable gait that replicates a footstep plan as closely as possible, that is, a sequence of candidate footstep positions and orientations with associated timings. For each footstep, the plan also specifies an associated reference height for the Center of Mass (CoM) and whether the robot should reach the footstep by walking or running. The scheme makes use of the Variable-Height Inverted Pendulum (VH-IP) as a prediction model, generating in real time both a CoM trajectory and adapted footsteps. The VH-IP model relates the position of the CoM to that of the Zero Moment Point (ZMP); to avoid falling, the ZMP must be inside a properly defined support region (a 3D extension of the 2D support polygon) whenever the robot is in contact with the ground. The nonlinearity of the VH-IP is handled by splitting the gait generation into two consecutive stages, both requiring to solve a quadratic program. Thanks to a particular triangular structure of the VH-IP dynamics, the first stage deals with the vertical dynamics using the Ground Reaction Force (GRF) as a decision variable. Using the prediction given by the first stage, the horizontal dynamics become linear time-varying. During the flight phases, the VH-IP collapses to a free-falling mass model. The proposed formulation incorporates constraints in order to maintain physically meaningful values of the GRF, keep the ZMP in the support region during contact phases, and ensure that the adapted footsteps are kinematically realizable. Most importantly, a stability constraint is enforced on the time-varying horizontal dynamics to guarantee a bounded evolution of the CoM with respect to the ZMP. Furthermore, we show how to extend the technique in order to perform running on tilted surfaces. We also describe a simple technique that receives input high-level velocity commands and generates a footstep plan in the form required by the proposed MPC scheme. The algorithm is validated via dynamic simulations on the full-scale humanoid robot HRP-4, as well as experiments on the small-sized robot OP3.},

The main contribution is a walking pattern generator, able to compute a stable trajectory of the center of mass of the robot along with the angular momentum, for any given configuration of contacts (e.g. on uneven, sloppy or slippery terrain, or with closed-gripper). Unlike existing methods, our solver is fast enough to be applied as a model-predictive controller. We then integrate this pattern generator in a complete framework: an acyclic contact planner is first used to automatically compute the contact sequence from a 3D model of the environment and a desired final posture; a stable walking pattern is then computed by the proposed solver; a dynamically-stable whole-body trajectory is finally obtained using a second-order hierarchical inverse kinematics. The implementation of the whole pipeline is fast enough to plan a step while the previous one is executed. The interest of the method is demonstrated by real experiments on the HRP-2 robot, by performing long-step walking and climbing a staircase with handrail support.},

In this example, the new method is shown to be 6.7 times faster than the basic matrix method, and 1.6 times faster than the efficient low-order algorithm of Rodriguez et al. Furthermore, cost savings of more than 50,000 arithmetic operations are obtained in the calculation of the inertia-weighted pseudoinverse of the task Jacobian and its null-space projection matrix.

Under mild assumptions about the degree of smoothness exhibit by the nonlinear functions, the algorithm is proven to be globally stable, with tracking errors converging to a neighborhood of zero. A constructive procedure is detailed, which directly translates the assumed smoothness properties of the nonlinearities involved into a specification of the network required to represent the plant to a chosen degree of accuracy.

abstract = {This paper develops a control methodology that unifies control barrier functions and control Lyapunov functions through quadratic programs. The result is demonstrated on adaptive cruise control, which presents both safety and performance considerations, as well as actuator bounds. We begin by presenting a novel notion of a barrier function associated with a set, formulated in the context of Lyapunov-like conditions; the existence of a barrier function satisfying these conditions implies forward invariance of the set. This formulation naturally yields a notion of control barrier function (CBF), yielding inequality constraints in the control input that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through these constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for the simultaneous achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs). These formulations are illustrated in the context of adaptive cruise control, where the control objective of achieving a desired speed is balanced by the minimum following conditions on a lead car and force-based constraints on acceleration and braking.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the dynamics of jointed flexible structures in multibody simulations. Joints are areas where the surfaces of substructures come into contact, for example, screwed or bolted joints. Depending on the spatial distribution of the joint, the overall dynamic behavior can be influenced significantly. Therefore, it is essential to consider the nonlinear contact and friction phenomena over the entire joint. In multibody dynamics, flexible bodies are often treated by the use of reduction methods, such as component mode synthesis (CMS). For jointed flexible structures, it is important to accurately compute the local deformations inside the joint in order to get a realistic representation of the nonlinear contact and friction forces. CMS alone is not suitable for the capture of these local nonlinearities and therefore is extended in this paper with problem-oriented trial vectors. The computation of these trial vectors is based on trial vector derivatives of the CMS reduction base. This paper describes the application of this extended reduction method to general multibody systems, under consideration of the contact and friction forces in the vector of generalized forces and the Jacobian. To ensure accuracy and numerical efficiency, different contact and friction models are investigated and evaluated. The complete strategy is applied to a multibody system containing a multilayered flexible structure. The numerical results confirm that the method leads to accurate results with low computational effort.},

abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) has seen many recent successes for quadruped robot control. The imitation of reference motions provides a simple and powerful prior for guiding solutions towards desired solutions without the need for meticulous reward design. While much work uses motion capture data or hand-crafted trajectories as the reference motion, relatively little work has explored the use of reference motions coming from model-based trajectory optimization. In this work, we investigate several design considerations that arise with such a framework, as demonstrated through four dynamic behaviours: trot, front hop, 180 backflip, and biped stepping. These are trained in simulation and transferred to a physical Solo 8 quadruped robot without further adaptation. In particular, we explore the space of feed-forward designs afforded by the trajectory optimizer to understand its impact on RL learning efficiency and sim-to-real transfer. These findings contribute to the long standing goal of producing robot controllers that combine the interpretability and precision of model-based optimization with the robustness that model-free RL-based controllers offer.},

The external wrenches, which arise from the physical interaction, must be taken into account in order to achieve robust and compliant balancing. This work presents a new control approach for combining multiobjective hierarchical control based on null space projections with passivity-based multicontact balancing for legged humanoid robots. In order to achieve a proper balancing, all task forces/torques are first distributed to the end effectors and then mapped into joint space considering the task hierarchy. The control approach is evaluated both in simulation and experiment with the humanoid robot TORO.},

A fast motion pattern generation technique that follows the desired ZMP is adopted. In order to satisfy the control input given online, subsequent motion patterns are updated and connected in a stable manner to the old ones while executing. During the creation of motion trajectories online, the commanded motion parameters are checked and modified automatically considering the performance limitations of the hardware. As an example application, we have implemented a one step cycle control system on the Humanoid H7.

While MPC for robotic systems has a long history, its paradigm such as problem formulations and algorithms has changed along with the recent drastic progress in robot hardware, computational processors, and algorithms. This survey paper reviews recent progress on MPC for legged and humanoid robotics from the following three points of view. First, we review a variety of dynamical models of robotic systems used in the MPC formulation. Second, we give an overview of MPC algorithms, particularly focusing on suitable ones for robotic problems. Finally, we introduce methods and applications of MPC for practical robotic problems from MPC based on reduced-order models to recent progress on MPC based on whole-body models.},

abstract = {We present a method for humanoid robot walking on partial footholds such as small stepping stones and rocks with sharp surfaces. Our algorithm does not rely on prior knowledge of the foothold, but information about an expected foothold can be used to improve the stepping performance. After a step is taken, the robot explores the new contact surface by attempting to shift the center of pressure around the foot. The available foothold is inferred by the way in which the foot rotates about contact edges and/or by the achieved center of pressure locations on the foot during exploration. This estimated contact area is then used by a whole body momentum-based control algorithm. To walk and balance on partial footholds, we combine fast, dynamic stepping with the use of upper body angular momentum to regain balance. We applied this method to the Atlas humanoid designed by Boston Dynamics to walk over small contact surfaces, such as line and point contacts. We present experimental results and discuss performance limitations.},

However, conventional controllers for legged locomotion are based on elaborate state machines that explicitly trigger the execution of motion primitives and reflexes. These designs have increased in complexity but fallen short of the generality and robustness of animal locomotion. Here, we present a robust controller for blind quadrupedal locomotion in challenging natural environments. Our approach incorporates proprioceptive feedback in locomotion control and demonstrates zero-shot generalization from simulation to natural environments. The controller is trained by reinforcement learning in simulation. The controller is driven by a neural network policy that acts on a stream of proprioceptive signals. The controller retains its robustness under conditions that were never encountered during training: deformable terrains such as mud and snow, dynamic footholds such as rubble, and overground impediments such as thick vegetation and gushing water. The presented work indicates that robust locomotion in natural environments can be achieved by training in simple domains.},

@article{Censi2015,
abstract = {One of the challenges of modern engineering, and robotics in particular, is designing complex systems, composed of many subsystems, rigorously and with optimality guarantees. This paper introduces a theory of co-design that describes "design problems", defined as tuples of "functionality space", "implementation space", and "resources space", together with a feasibility relation that relates the three spaces. Design problems can be interconnected together to create "co-design problems", which describe possibly recursive co-design constraints among subsystems. A co-design problem induces a family of optimization problems of the type "find the minimal resources needed to implement a given functionality"; the solution is an antichain (Pareto front) of resources. A special class of co-design problems are Monotone Co-Design Problems (MCDPs), for which functionality and resources are complete partial orders and the feasibility relation is monotone and Scott continuous. The induced optimization problems are multi-objective, nonconvex, nondifferentiable, noncontinuous, and not even defined on continuous spaces; yet, there exists a complete solution. The antichain of minimal resources can be characterized as a least fixed point, and it can be computed using Kleene's algorithm. The computation needed to solve a co-design problem can be bounded by a function of a graph property that quantifies the interdependence of the subproblems. These results make us much more optimistic about the problem of designing complex systems in a rigorous way.},

The high level is designed as an optimal feedback controller operating on a simplified virtual plant. The low level is responsible for transforming the dynamics of the true plant into the desired virtual dynamics. The new method may be useful not only for modelling the neural control of movement, but also for designing functional electric stimulation systems that have to achieve task goals by activating muscles in real time.},

abstract = {Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is widely used in machine learning. Although being commonly viewed as a fast but not accurate version of gradient descent (GD), it always finds better solutions than GD for modem neural networks. In order to understand this phenomenon, we take an alternative view that SGD is working on the convolved (thus smoothed) version of the loss function. We show that, even if the function/has many bad local minima or saddle points, as long as for every point x, the weighted average of the gradients of its neighborhoods is one point convex with respect to the desired solution x∗, SGD will get close to, and then stay around x∗ with constant probability. Our result identifies a set of functions that SGD provably works, which is much larger than the set of convex functions. Empirically, we observe that the loss surface of neural networks enjoys nice one point convexity properties locally, therefore our theorem helps explain why SGD works so well for neural networks.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel contact-implicit tra-jectory optimization method using an analytically solvable contact model to enable planning of interactions with hard, soft, and slippery environments. Specifically, we propose a novel contact model that can be computed in closed-form, satisfies friction cone constraints and can be embedded into direct trajectory optimization frameworks without complementarity constraints. The closed-form solution decouples the computation of the contact forces from other actuation forces and this property is used to formulate a minimal direct optimization problem expressed with configuration variables only. Our simulation study demonstrates the advantages over the rigid contact model and a trajectory optimization approach based on complementarity constraints. The proposed model enables physics-based optimization for a wide range of interactions with hard, slippery, and soft grounds in a unified manner expressed by two parameters only. By computing trotting and jumping motions for a quadruped robot, the proposed optimization demonstrates the versatility for multi-contact motion planning on surfaces with different physical properties.},

This allows one to characterize necessary conditions for optimality and develop training algorithms that do not rely on gradients with respect to the trainable parameters. In particular, we introduce the discrete-time method of successive approximations (MSA), which is based on the Pontryagin's maximum principle, for training neural networks. A rigorous error estimate for the discrete MSA is obtained, which sheds light on its dynamics and the means to stabilize the algorithm. The developed methods are applied to train, in a rather principled way, neural networks with weights that are constrained to take values in a discrete set. We obtain competitive performance and interestingly, very sparse weights in the case of ternary networks, which may be useful in model deployment in low-memory devices.},

abstract = {Manipulation of structured objects connected to the environment by a kinematics chain involves two problems: (a) The objects have movable directions and unmovable directions. An undesired reaction force in the unmovable directions prevents a robot from successful manipulation; (b) The reaction forces from the objects could fluctuate during manipulation. Related works have enabled robots to manipulate objects by integrating position control in movable directions and force control in unmovable directions at the hands. However, in the case of a humanoid robot, too large undesired reaction forces in movable directions cause the robot's falling down and slipping. In this paper, we propose a controller system controlling reaction forces at the hands and successively updating reference forces based on reaction forces. For problem (a), we apply force control both to the movable and unmovable directions in order to satisfy both maintaining full-body balance and achieving manipulation. For problem (b), the update of the reference forces enables the humanoid robot to adapt to fluctuation of the reaction forces. We show experimental results on the cmanipulating four doors and a drawer.},

@techreport{Medrano-Cerda2018,
abstract = {This paper presents three distinct techniques, aimed at the online active impedance regulation of compliant humanoid robots, which endeavours to induce a state of balance to the system once it has been perturbed. The presence of passive elastic elements in the drives powering this class of robots leads to under-actuation, thereby rendering the control of compliant robots an intricate task. Consequently, the impedance regulation procedures proposed in this paper directly account for these elastic elements. In order to acquire an indication of the robot's state of balance in an online fashion, an energy (Lyapunov) function is introduced, whose sign then allows one to ascertain whether the robot is converging to or diverging from, a desired equilibrium position. Computing this function's time derivative unequivocally gives the energy-injecting nature of the active stiffness regulation, and reveals that active damping regulation has no bearing on the system's state of stability. Furthermore, the velocity margin notion is interpreted as a velocity value beyond which the system's balance might be jeopardized, or below which the robot will be guaranteed to remain stable. As a result, the unidirectional and bidirectional impedance optimization methods rely upon the use of bounds that have been defined based on the energy function's derivative, in addition to the velocity margin. Contrarily, the third technique's functionality revolves solely around the use of Lyapunov Stability Margins (LSMs). A series of experiments carried out using the COmpliant huMANoid (COMAN), demonstrates the superior balancing results acquired when using the bidirectional scheme, as compared to utilizing the two alternative techniques.},

abstract = {Linear models for control and motion generation of humanoid robots have received significant attention in the past years, not only due to their well known theoretical guarantees, but also because of practical computational advantages. However, to tackle more challenging tasks and scenarios such as locomotion on uneven terrain, a more expressive model is required. In this paper, we are interested in contact interaction-centered motion optimization based on the momentum dynamics model. This model is non-linear and non-convex; however, we find a relaxation of the problem that allows us to formulate it as a single convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) that can be very efficiently optimized. Furthermore, experimental results suggest that this relaxation is tight and therefore useful for multi-contact planning. This convex model is then coupled to the optimization of end-effector contacts location using a mixed integer program, which can be solved in realtime. This becomes relevant e.g. to recover from external pushes, where a predefined stepping plan is likely to fail and an online adaptation of the contact location is needed. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated in several multi-contact scenarios for humanoid robot.},

abstract = {In this paper, a sample nonlinear contact model is pre- sented for use in computer simulation. The nonlinear model is shown to maintain the computational sim- plicity of the linear model while addressing many of its deficiencies. One such advantage is that contact forces vary continuously over time. A new phase plane solution for the nonlinear model is obtained which re- veals many previously unnoted properties. These in- clude proper variation of the coejjicient of restitution with impact velocity over a wide range of impact ve- locities, independence of model parameters, and lack of tensile (sticking) forces in simple impacts. An example is presented which demonstrates the use of the contact model in simulating the foot-ground interaction during the locomotion cycle of a walking machine},

While al- ternative techniques for computing the reachable set have been proposed, the differential game formulation allows treatment of nonlinear systems with inputs and uncertain parameters. Because the time-dependent equation's solution is continuous and defined throughout the state space, methods from the level set literature can be used to generate more accurate approximations than are possible for formulations with potentially discontinuous solutions. A numerical implementation of our formulation is described and has been released on the web. Its correctness is verified through a two vehicle, three dimensional collision avoidance example for which an analytic solution is available.},

abstract = {Achieving agile maneuvers through multiple contact phases has been a longstanding challenge in legged robotics. It requires to derive motion plans and local control feedback policies in real-time to handle the nonholonomy of the kinetic momenta. While a few recent predictive control approaches based on centroidal momentum have been able to generate dynamic motions, they assume unlimited actuation capabilities. This assumption is quite restrictive and does not hold for agile maneuvers on most robots. In this work, we present a contact-phase predictive and state-feedback controllers that enables legged robots to plan and perform agile locomotion skills. Our predictive controller models the contact phases using a hybrid paradigm that considers the robot's actuation limits and full dynamics. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on agile maneuvers on ANYmal robots in realistic scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to show that predictive control can handle actuation limits, generate agile locomotion maneuvers and execute locally optimal feedback policies on hardware without the use of a separate whole-body controller.},

We present tasks of increasing complexity leading to a combination of three-dimensional (re-)orientation and landing locomotion behaviors of a quadruped robot traversing simulated low-gravity celestial bodies. We show that our approach easily generalizes across these tasks and successfully trains policies for each case. Using sim-to-real transfer, we deploy trained policies in the real world on the SpaceBok robot placed on an experimental testbed designed for two-dimensional micro-gravity experiments.

abstract = {We present a framework for online generation of robust motion plans for robotic systems with nonlinear dynamics subject to bounded disturbances, control constraints, and online state constraints such as obstacles. In an offline phase, one computes the structure of a feedback controller that can be efficiently implemented online to track any feasible nominal trajectory. The offline phase leverages contraction theory and convex optimization to characterize a fixed-size 'tube' that the state is guaranteed to remain within while tracking a nominal trajectory (representing the center of the tube). In the online phase, when the robot is faced with obstacles, a motion planner uses such a tube as a robustness margin for collision checking, yielding nominal trajectories that can be safely executed, i.e., tracked without collisions under disturbances. In contrast to recent work on robust online planning using funnel libraries, our approach is not restricted to a fixed library of maneuvers computed offline and is thus particularly well-suited to applications such as UAV flight in densely cluttered environments where complex maneuvers may be required to reach a goal. We demonstrate our approach through simulations of a 6-state planar quadrotor navigating cluttered environments in the presence of a cross-wind. We also discuss applications of our approach to Tube Model Predictive Control (TMPC) and compare the merits of our method with state-of-the-art nonlinear TMPC techniques.},

But for nuclear applications, the objective is not so much to replace workers as it is to extend their presence - for example, to project their reach into areas of a nuclear plant where the thermal or radiation environment prohibits or limits a human presence. The economic motivation to use robots for nuclear plant inspection and maintenance is centered on their potential for improving plant availability; a by-product is the potential for reducing the occupational radiation exposure of plant personnel. Robotic equipment in nuclear applications may be divided into two broad categories: single-purpose devices with limited ability to perform different operations, and reprogrammable, multi-purpose robots with some degree of computer-based artificial intelligence. Preliminary assessments of the potential for applying robotics in nuclear power plants - mainly at surveillance and inspection tasks - have been carried out. Future developments are considered},

abstract = {Trajectory optimization with contact-rich behaviors has recently gained attention for generating diverse locomotion behaviors without pre-specified ground contact sequences. However, these approaches rely on precise models of robot dynamics and the terrain and are susceptible to uncertainty. Recent works have attempted to handle uncertainties in the system model, but few have investigated uncertainty in contact dynamics. In this study, we model uncertainty stemming from the terrain and design corresponding risk-sensitive objectives under the framework of contact-implicit trajectory optimization. In particular, we parameterize uncertainties from the terrain contact distance and friction coefficients using probability distributions and propose a corresponding expected residual minimization cost design approach. We evaluate our method in three simple robotic examples, including a legged hopping robot, and we benchmark one of our examples in simulation against a robust worst-case solution. We show that our risk-sensitive method produces contact-averse trajectories that are robust to terrain perturbations. Moreover, we demonstrate that the resulting trajectories converge to those generated by a traditional, non-robust method as the terrain model becomes more certain. Our study marks an important step towards a fully robust, contact-implicit approach suitable for deploying robots on real-world terrain.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks' to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0.

abstract = {In human-robot interaction, it is essential to ensure that the robot poses no threat to the human. Especially in applications that require close or physical interaction, e.g., collaborative manufacturing or rehabilitation, the danger emanating from the robot has to be minimized. Control schemes introducing virtual constraints have proven valuable in this context since they allow us to define a safe zone to move in without endangering the human. Combining the different requirements on the control scheme, such as real-time capability, stability, and reliability, in the presence of external disturbances and dynamic limits, however, turns out to be challenging. In this paper, we present a novel control scheme for human-robot interaction, which enforces dynamic constraints even in the presence of external forces. Based on an analytic constraint description and a feedback linearization of the system dynamics, a safe set of states is determined, which is then rendered controlled positively invariant, thus keeping the system in a safe configuration. The controlled system is analyzed with respect to invariance and boundedness with the results being illustrated in a full-scale experiment.},

We address the question of whether the average angular velocity defines an orientation framethat depends only on the current robot configuration and provide a simple algebraic condition to check whether this holds. In the language of geometric mechanics, this condition corresponds to requiring the flatness of the mechanical connection associated to the robotic system. Here, however, we provide both a reinterpretation and a proof of this result accessible to readers with a background in rigid body kinematics and multibody dynamics but not necessarily acquainted with differential geometry, still providing precise links to the geometric mechanics literature. This should help spreading the algebraic condition beyond the scope of geometric mechanics,contributing to a proper utilization and understanding of the concept of average angular velocity.},

abstract = {The physical design of a robot and the policy that controls its motion are inherently coupled. However, existing approaches largely ignore this coupling, instead choosing to alternate between separate design and control phases, which requires expert intuition throughout and risks convergence to suboptimal designs. In this work, we propose a method that jointly optimizes over the physical design of a robot and the corresponding control policy in a model-free fashion, without any need for expert supervision. For an arbitrary robot morphology, our method maintains a distribution over design parameters and uses reinforcement learning to train a shared neural network controller for sampled designs. Throughout training, we use our policy network to quickly evaluate new designs and refine the robot distribution to maximize expected reward. This results in an assignment to the robot parameters and neural network policy that are jointly optimal. We evaluate our approach in the context of legged locomotion, and demonstrate that it discovers novel robot designs and walking gaits for several different morphologies, achieving performance better than a baseline and hand-crafted designs.},

In particular, there still is a need for a comprehensive numerical tool capable of predicting the outcome of a balance perturbation, including in particular the three elementary recovery strategies: ankle, hip and stepping with variable step duration. In order to fill this gap we further developed a previously proposed multiple step balance recovery prediction tool to include the use of the hip strategy and variable step duration. Simulated recovery reactions are compared against observations from different experimental situations from the literature. Reasonable accuracy in terms of step positions and durations were obtained for these different situations using a single set of controller parameters. Moreover, variations in the use of the hip strategy and the step duration between situations were consistent with biomechanical observations. Such a model could be useful to better understand the balance recovery mechanisms, and could also be used to identify potentially hazardous situations.},

abstract = {We introduce Crocoddyl (Contact RObot COntrol by Differential DYnamic Library), an open-source framework tailored for efficient multi-contact optimal control. Crocoddyl efficiently computes the state trajectory and the control policy for a given predefined sequence of contacts. Its efficiency is due to the use of sparse analytical derivatives, exploitation of the problem structure, and data sharing. It employs differential geometry to properly describe the state of any geometrical system, e.g. floating-base systems. Additionally, we propose a novel optimal control algorithm called Feasibility-driven Differential Dynamic Programming (FDDP). Our method does not add extra decision variables which often increases the computation time per iteration due to factorization. FDDP shows a greater globalization strategy compared to classical Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithms. Concretely, we propose two modifications to the classical DDP algorithm. First, the backward pass accepts infeasible state-control trajectories. Second, the rollout keeps the gaps open during the early exploratory iterations (as expected in multipleshooting methods with only equality constraints). We showcase the performance of our framework using different tasks. With our method, we can compute highly-dynamic maneuvers (e.g. jumping, front-flip) within few milliseconds.},

Herein the recent DLR results on torque-, position-, as well as impedance control of flexible joint robots are summarized, and the relations between the individual contributions are highlighted. It is shown that an inner torque feedback loop can be incorporated into a passivity based analysis by interpreting torque feedback in terms of shaping of the motor inertia. This result, which implicitly was already included in our earlier works on torque- and position control, can also be seized for the design of impedance controllers. For impedance control, furthermore, potential shaping is of special interest. It is shown how, based only on the motor angles, a potential function can be designed which simultaneously incorporates gravity compensation and a desired Cartesian stiffness relation for the link angles.},

abstract = {This work presents a new control approach to multi-contact balancing for torque-controlled humanoid robots. The con- troller includes a non-strict task hierarchy, which allows the robot to use a subset of its end effectors for balancing while the remaining ones can be used for interacting with the environment. The controller creates a passive and compliant behavior for regulating the center of mass (CoM) location, hip orientation and the poses of each end effector assigned to the interaction task. This is achieved by applying a suitable wrench (force and torque) at each one of the end effectors used for interaction. The contact wrenches at the balancing end effectors are chosen such that the sum of the balancing and interaction wrenches produce the desired wrench at the CoM. The algorithm requires the solution of an optimization prob- lem, which distributes the CoM wrench to the end effectors taking into account constraints for unilaterality, friction and position of the center of pressure. Furthermore, the feedback controller is combined with a feedforward control in order to improve performance while tracking a predefined trajectory, leading to a control structure similar to a PD+ control. The controller is evaluated in several experiments with the humanoid robot TORO.},

abstract = {Multi-objective control systems for complex robots usually have to handle multiple prioritized tasks. Most existing hierarchical control techniques handle either strict task priorities by using null-space projectors or a sequence of quadratic programs; or non strict task priorities by using a weighting strategy. This paper proposes a novel approach to handle both strict and non-strict priorities of an arbitrary number of tasks. It can achieve multiple priority rearrangements simultaneously. A generalized projector, which makes it possible to completely project a task into the null-space of a set of tasks, while partially projecting it into the null-space of some other tasks, is developed. This projector can be used to perform priority transitions and task insertion or deletion. The control input is computed by solving one quadratic programming problem, where generalized projectors are adopted to maintain a task hierarchy, and equality or inequality constraints can be implemented. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on a simulated robotic manipulator in a dynamic environment.},

abstract = {Dexterous object manipulation remains an open problem in robotics, despite the rapid progress in machine learning during the past decade. We argue that a hindrance is the high cost of experimentation on real systems, in terms of both time and money. We address this problem by proposing an open-source robotic platform which can safely operate without human supervision. The hardware is inexpensive (about \SI{5000}[\$]{}) yet highly dynamic, robust, and capable of complex interaction with external objects. The software operates at 1-kilohertz and performs safety checks to prevent the hardware from breaking. The easy-to-use front-end (in C++ and Python) is suitable for real-time control as well as deep reinforcement learning. In addition, the software framework is largely robot-agnostic and can hence be used independently of the hardware proposed herein. Finally, we illustrate the potential of the proposed platform through a number of experiments, including real-time optimal control, deep reinforcement learning from scratch, throwing, and writing.},

abstract = {Proteins are chains of simple molecules called amino acids. The three-dimensional shape of a protein and its amino acid composition define its biological function. Over millions of years, living organisms have evolved a large catalog of proteins. By exploring the space of possible amino acid sequences, protein engineering aims at similarly designing tailored proteins with specific desirable properties. In Computational Protein Design (CPD), the challenge of identifying a protein that performs a given task is defined as the combinatorial optimization of a complex energy function over amino acid sequences. In this paper, we introduce the CPD problem and some of the main approaches that have been used by structural biologists to solve it, with an emphasis on the exact method embodied in the dead-end elimination/{\ss} algorithm (DEE/{\ss}). The CPD problem is a specific form of binary Cost Function Network (CFN, aka Weighted CSP). We show how DEE algorithms can be incorporated and suitably modified to be maintained during search, at reasonable computational cost. We then evaluate the efficiency of CFN algorithms as implemented in our solver toulbar2, on a set of real CPD instances built in collaboration with structural biologists. The CPD problem can be easily reduced to 0/1 Linear Programming, 0/1 Quadratic Programming, 0/1 Quadratic Optimization, Weighted Partial MaxSAT and Graphical Model optimization problems. We compare toulbar2 with these different approaches using a variety of solvers. We observe tremendous differences in the difficulty that each approach has on these instances. Overall, the CFN approach shows the best efficiency on these problems, improving by several orders of magnitude against the exact DEE/{\ss} approach. The introduction of dead-end elimination before or during search allows to further improve these results. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

This approximation, requiring a single function evaluation at a complex argument, generalizes the complex step approximation known in the scalar case. The approximation is proved to be of second order in h for analytic functions f and also for the matrix sign function. It is shown that it does not suffer the inherent cancellation that limits the accuracy of finite difference approximations in floating point arithmetic. However, cancellation does nevertheless vitiate the approximation when the underlying method for evaluating f employs complex arithmetic. The ease of implementation of the approximation, and its superiority over finite differences, make it attractive when specialized methods for evaluating the Fr{\'{e}}chet derivative are not available, and in particular for condition number estimation when used in conjunction with a block 1-norm estimation algorithm. {\textcopyright} Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.},

In this paper, we compare a number of solvers for an extended formulation of the LQ control problem: a Riccati recursion based solver can be considered the best choice for the general problem with dense matrices. Furthermore, we present a novel version of the Riccati solver, that makes use of the Cholesky factorization of the Pn matrices to reduce the number of flops. When combined with regularization and mixed precision, this algorithm can solve large instances of the LQ control problem up to 3 times faster than the classical Riccati solver. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {In this paper we seek to quantify and explicitly optimize the robustness of a control system for a robot walking on terrain with uncertain geometry. Geometric perturbations to the terrain enter the equations of motion through a relocation of the hybrid event “guards” which trigger an impact event; these perturbations can have a large effect on the stability of the robot and do not fit into the traditional robust control analysis and design methodologies without additional machinery. We attempt to provide that machinery here. In particular, we quantify the robustness of the system to terrain perturbations by defining an L2 gain from terrain perturbations to deviations from the nominal limit cycle. We show that the solution to a periodic dissipation inequality provides a sufficient upper bound on this gain for a linear approximation of the dynamics around the limit cycle, and we formulate a semidefinite programming problem to compute the L2 gain for the system with a fixed linear controller. We then use either binary search or an iterative optimization method to construct a linear robust controller and to minimize the L2 gain. The simulation results on canonical robots suggest that the L2 gain is closely correlated to the actual number of steps traversed on the rough terrain, and our controller can improve the robot's robustness to terrain disturbances.},

One of the key challenges in manipulation is the exploration of the dynamics of the environment when there is continuous contact between the objects being manipulated. This paper proposes a model-based active exploration approach that enables efficient learning in sparse-reward robotic manipulation tasks. The proposed method estimates an information gain objective using an ensemble of probabilistic models and deploys model predictive control (MPC) to plan actions online that maximize the expected reward while also performing directed exploration. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in simulation and on a real robot, trained from scratch with our method, on a challenging ball pushing task on tilted tables, where the target ball position is not known to the agent a-priori. Our real-world robot experiment serves as a fundamental application of active exploration in model-based reinforcement learning of complex robotic manipulation tasks.

It is also one of the most promising alternatives to prevalent fabrication of conducting polymer actuators. Nevertheless, inkjet printed actuators were not yet realised due to rheological properties of conducting polymer solutions that challenge jetting and the complex solution-membrane interactions, that lead to poor adhesion or uncontrolled infiltration. In order to enable this fabrication method, hybrid hydrophilic-hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes were used. They ensure good adhesion with printed poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) layer. Furthermore, PEDOT:PSS compositions that have liquid properties suitable for printing but do not cause uncontrolled infiltration through the membrane were identified. This allowed the realisation of the first inkjet printed PEDOT:PSS based ionic actuators working in air.},

abstract = {We present a new method of learning control policies that successfully operate under unknown dynamic models. We create such policies by leveraging a large number of training examples that are generated using a physical simulator. Our system is made of two components: a Universal Policy (UP) and a function for Online System Identification (OSI). We describe our control policy as universal because it is trained over a wide array of dynamic models. These variations in the dynamic model may include differences in mass and inertia of the robots' components, variable friction coefficients, or unknown mass of an object to be manipulated. By training the Universal Policy with this variation, the control policy is prepared for a wider array of possible conditions when executed in an unknown environment. The second part of our system uses the recent state and action history of the system to predict the dynamics model parameters mu. The value of mu from the Online System Identification is then provided as input to the control policy (along with the system state). Together, UP-OSI is a robust control policy that can be used across a wide range of dynamic models, and that is also responsive to sudden changes in the environment. We have evaluated the performance of this system on a variety of tasks, including the problem of cart-pole swing-up, the double inverted pendulum, locomotion of a hopper, and block-throwing of a manipulator. UP-OSI is effective at these tasks across a wide range of dynamic models. Moreover, when tested with dynamic models outside of the training range, UP-OSI outperforms the Universal Policy alone, even when UP is given the actual value of the model dynamics. In addition to the benefits of creating more robust controllers, UP-OSI also holds out promise of narrowing the Reality Gap between simulated and real physical systems.},

As an example, we applied our method to a simulated five link biped robot. The results show lower joint torques from the optimal control policy compared to a hand-tuned PD servo controller. Results also show that the simulated biped robot can successfully walk with unknown disturbances that cause controllers generated by standard differential dynamic programming and the hand-tuned PD servo to fail. Learning to compensate for modeling error and previously unknown disturbances in conjunction with robust control design is also demonstrated.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

Unlike other existing schemes, it provides fully adaptable height, adaptable step placement and complete kinematic and dynamic feasibility guarantees, making it possible to walk perfectly safely on a piecewise horizontal ground such as stairs. A linear formulation is proposed, based on efficiently bounding the nonlinear term introduced by vertical motion, considering two linear constraints instead of one nonlinear constraint. Balance and Passive Safety guarantees are secured by enforcing a 3D capturability constraint. Based on a comparison between CoM and CoP trajectories involving ex-ponentials instead of polynomials, this capturability constraint involves a CoM motion stopping along a segment of line, always maintaining complete kinematic and dynamic feasibility.},

abstract = {Fast and safe navigation of dynamical systems through a priori unknown cluttered environments is vital to many applications of autonomous systems. However, trajectory planning for autonomous systems is computationally intensive, often requiring simplified dynamics that sacrifice safety and dynamic feasibility in order to plan efficiently. Conversely, safe trajectories can be computed using more sophisticated dynamic models, but this is typically too slow to be used for real-time planning. We present the new algorithm FaSTrack: Fast and Safe Tracking. A path or trajectory planner using simplified dynamics to plan quickly can be incorporated into the FaSTrack framework, which provides a safety controller for the vehicle along with a guaranteed tracking error bound. This bound captures all possible deviations due to high dimensional dynamics and external disturbances. FaSTrack is modular and can be used with most current path or trajectory planners. We demonstrate this framework using a 10D nonlinear quadrotor model tracking a 3D path obtained from an RRT planner.},

The problem of maximisation of the attraction region is recast as a well-defined optimisation problem. By an LMI based optimisation approach, the terminal weighting item and fictitious terminal stabilising control law are optimised to enlarge the attraction domain and hence the feasibility domain of the nonlinear MPC method.

abstract = {— Humanoid robots are designed with dozens of actuated joints to suit a variety of tasks, but walking controllers rarely make the best use of all of this freedom. We present a framework for maximizing the use of the full humanoid body for the purpose of stable dynamic locomotion, which requires no restriction to a planning template (e.g. LIPM). Using a hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) framework, this approach optimizes a set of outputs which provides requirements for the motion for all actuated links, including arms. These output equations are then rapidly solved by a whole-body inverse-kinematic (IK) solver, providing a set of joint trajectories to the robot. We apply this procedure to a simulation of the humanoid robot, DRC-HUBO, which has over 27 actuators. As a consequence, the resulting gaits swing their arms, not by a user defining swinging motions a priori or superimposing them on gaits post hoc, but as an emergent behavior from optimizing the dynamic gait. We also present preliminary dynamic walking experiments with DRC-HUBO in hardware, thereby building a case that hybrid zero dynamics as augmented by inverse kinematics (HZD+IK) is becoming a viable approach for controlling the full complexity of humanoid locomotion.},

This paper contributes a first approach toward enforcing formal safety constraints on end-to-end policies with visual inputs. Our approach draws on recent advances in object detection and automated reasoning for hybrid dynamical systems. The approach is evaluated on a novel benchmark that emphasizes the challenge of safely exploring in the presence of hard constraints. Our benchmark draws from several proposed problem sets for safe learning and includes problems that emphasize challenges such as reward signals that are not aligned with safety constraints. On each of these benchmark problems, our algorithm completely avoids unsafe behavior while remaining competitive at optimizing for as much reward as is safe. We also prove that our method of enforcing the safety constraints preserves all safe policies from the original environment.},

The presented architecture stems from the parametrization of the feasible joints position and velocity space by exogenous states. The proposed parametrization transforms the control problem with constrained states to an un-constrained one by replacing the joints position and velocity with the exogenous states. With the help of Lyapunov-based arguments, we prove that the proposed control architecture ensures the stability and convergence of the desired joint trajectory along with the joints position and velocity limits avoidance.

The periodic motion is planned via point foot (underactuated) ROMs for dynamic motion with minimum ankle actuation, while the transitional motion is planned via foot-actuated ROMs for fast and smooth transition. Composition of the planar COM dynamics yields the desired COM dynamics in 3D, which is embedded on the humanoid via control Lyapunov function based Quadratic programs (CLF-QPs). Additionally, the ground reaction force profiles of the aSLIP walking are used as desired references for ground contact forces in the CLF-QPs for smooth domain transitions.

abstract = {Multiphysics problems involving two or more coupled physical phenomena are ubiquitous in science and engineering. This work develops a new partitioned exponential approach for the time integration of multiphysics problems. After a possible semi-discretization in space, the class of problems under consideration is modeled by a system of ordinary differential equations where the right-hand side is a summation of two component functions, each corresponding to a given set of physical processes. The partitioned-exponential methods proposed herein evolve each component of the system via an exponential integrator, and information between partitions is exchanged via coupling terms. The traditional approach to constructing exponential methods, based on the variation-of-constants formula, is not directly applicable to partitioned systems. Rather, our approach to developing new partitioned-exponential families is based on a general-structure additive formulation of the schemes. Two method formulations are considered, one based on a linear-nonlinear splitting of the right hand component functions, and another based on approximate Jacobians. The paper develops classical (non-stiff) order conditions theory for partitioned exponential schemes based on particular families of T-trees and B-series theory. Several practical methods of third order are constructed that extend the Rosenbrock-type and EPIRK families of exponential integrators. Several implementation optimizations specific to the application of these methods to reaction-diffusion systems are also discussed. Numerical experiments reveal that the new partitioned-exponential methods can perform better than traditional unpartitioned exponential methods on some problems.},

@article{Boffi2020,
abstract = {Many existing tools in nonlinear control theory for establishing stability or safety of a dynamical system can be distilled to the construction of a certificate function that guarantees a desired property. However, algorithms for synthesizing certificate functions typically require a closed-form analytical expression of the underlying dynamics, which rules out their use on many modern robotic platforms. To circumvent this issue, we develop algorithms for learning certificate functions only from trajectory data. We establish bounds on the generalization error – the probability that a certificate will not certify a new, unseen trajectory – when learning from trajectories, and we convert such generalization error bounds into global stability guarantees. We demonstrate empirically that certificates for complex dynamics can be efficiently learned, and that the learned certificates can be used for downstream tasks such as adaptive control.},

abstract = {This study proposes a biped robot state estimation framework based on a compliant inverted pendulum model and a robust state estimator. A proper model that can express the key physical characteristics while considering limited computing power should be defined for the biped robot state estimation. A biped robot's limited structural stiffness and relatively long legs compared with the cross section of the body lead to undesired flexibility. However, the models used in previous research are either not suitable for state estimation or too simple to express the essential characteristics of the biped robot. A compliant inverted pendulum model is adopted herein to enhance the estimation accuracy. This model is made by adding a virtual spring and a damper to the conventional inverted pendulum. The additional elements represent the mechanical deformation and the undesired flexible movement. Adopting this model makes it possible to reflect the important characteristics of the biped robot while taking advantage of the merits of the single-mass model. In addition, a robust state estimator that we previously proposed is adopted to compensate for the estimation error caused by the modeling error. Using these two factors, the improved COM-kinematics estimate is obtained with respect to the existing simple-model-based biped state estimators.},

First, we present a method which exactly certifies sufficient conditions for invariance despite relying on approximate trajectories from numerical integration. Our second method relaxes the constraints of the first by sampling in time. In applications, this can recover almost identical funnels but is much faster to compute. In both cases, funnels are verified using Sum-of-Squares programming to search over a family of time-varying polynomial Lyapunov functions. Initial candidate Lyapunov functions are constructed using the linearization about the trajectory, and associated time-varying Lyapunov and Riccati differential equations. The methods are compared on stabilized trajectories of a six-state model of a satellite.},

abstract = {The graduated optimization approach, also known as the continuation method, is a popular heuristic to solving non-convcx problems that has received renewed interest over the last decade. Despite being popular, very little is known in terms of its theoretical convergence analysis. In this paper we describe a new first-order algorithm based on graduated optimization and analyze its performance. We characterize a family of non-convex functions for which this algorithm provably converges to a global optimum. In particular, we prove that the algorithm converges to an ϵ-approximate solution within O( 1/ϵ4) gradient-based steps. We extend our algorithm and analysis to the setting of stochastic non-convex optimization with noisy gradient feedback, attaining the same convergence rate. Additionally, we discuss the setting of "zero- order optimization", and devise a variant of our algorithm which converges at rate of O(d2/ϵ4).},

We construct a policy optimization algorithm that uses the pathwise derivative of the learned model and policy across future timesteps. Instabilities of learning across many timesteps are prevented by using a terminal value function, learning the policy in an actor-critic fashion. Furthermore, we present a derivation on the monotonic improvement of our objective in terms of the gradient error in the model and value function.

abstract = {This paper presents an implementation of model predictive control (MPC) to determine ground reaction forces for a torque-controlled quadruped robot. The robot dynamics are simplified to formulate the problem as convex optimization while still capturing the full 3D nature of the system. With the simplified model, ground reaction force planning problems are formulated for prediction horizons of up to 0.5 seconds, and are solved to optimality in under 1 ms at a rate of 20-30 Hz. Despite using a simplified model, the robot is capable of robust locomotion at a variety of speeds. Experimental results demonstrate control of gaits including stand, trot, flying-trot, pronk, bound, pace, a 3-legged gait, and a full 3D gallop. The robot achieved forward speeds of up to 3 m/s, lateral speeds up to 1 m/s, and angular speeds up to 180 deg/sec. Our approach is general enough to perform all these behaviors with the same set of gains and weights.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. This paper deals with the generation of motion for complex dynamical systems (such as humanoid robots) to achieve several concurrent objectives. Hierarchy of tasks and optimal control are two frameworks commonly used to this aim. The first one specifies control objectives as a number of quadratic functions to be minimized under strict priorities. The second one minimizes an arbitrary user-defined function of the future state of the system, thus considering its evolution in time. Our recent work on prioritized optimal control merges the advantages of both these methods. This paper reformulates the original prioritized optimal control algorithm with the precise goal of improving its computational speed. We extend the dynamic programming method to work with a hierarchy of tasks. We compared our approach in simulation with both our previous algorithm and classical optimal control. The measured computational improvement represents another step towards the application of prioritized optimal control for online model predictive control of humanoid robots. We believe that this could be the key to unlock the (so far unexploited) dynamic capabilities of these mechanical systems.},

@article{Gori2010,
abstract = {A long-standing question, going back at least 300 years to Berkeley's famous essay, is how sensory systems become calibrated with physical reality. We recently showed [1] that children younger than 8-10 years do not integrate visual and haptic information optimally, but that one or the other sense prevails: touch for size and vision for orientation discrimination. The sensory dominance may reflect crossmodal calibration of vision and touch, where the more accurate sense calibrates the other. This hypothesis leads to a clear prediction: that lack of clear vision at an early age should affect calibration of haptic orientation discrimination. We therefore measured size and orientation haptic discrimination thresholds in 17 congenitally visually impaired children (aged 5-19). Haptic orientation thresholds were greatly impaired compared with age-matched controls, whereas haptic size thresholds were at least as good, and often better. One child with a late-acquired visual impairment stood out with excellent orientation discrimination. The results provide strong support for our crossmodal calibration hypothesis.},

abstract = {The synthesis of human motion is a complex procedure that involves accurate reconstruction of movement sequences, modeling of musculoskeletal kinematics, dynamics and actuation, and characterization of reliable performance criteria. Many of these processes have much in common with the problems found in robotics research. Task-based methods used in robotics may be leveraged to provide novel musculoskeletal modeling methods and physiologically accurate performance predictions. In this paper, we present (i) a new method for the real-time reconstruction of human motion trajectories using direct marker tracking, (ii) a task-driven muscular effort minimization criterion and (iii) new human performance metrics for dynamic characterization of athletic skills. Dynamic motion reconstruction is achieved through the control of a simulated human model to follow the captured marker trajectories in real-time. The operational space control and real-time simulation provide human dynamics at any configuration of the performance. A new criteria of muscular effort minimization has been introduced to analyze human static postures. Extensive motion capture experiments were conducted to validate the new minimization criterion. Finally, new human performance metrics were introduced to study in details an athletic skill. These metrics include the effort expenditure and the feasible set of operational space accelerations during the performance of the skill. The dynamic characterization takes into account skeletal kinematics as well as muscle routing kinematics and force generating capacities. The developments draw upon an advanced musculoskeletal modeling platform and a task-oriented framework for the effective integration of biomechanics and robotics methods.},

The proposed approach is based on casting the search for the invariant set as a graph theoretical problem. Specifically, a general class of discrete-time time-invariant nonlinear systems is considered. First, the dynamics of a nonlinear system is approximated with a directed graph. Subsequently, the condition for robust control invariance is derived and an algorithm for computing the robust control invariant set is presented. The algorithm combines the iterative subdivision technique with the robust control invariance condition to produce outer approximations of the largest robust control invariant set at each iteration. Following this, we prove convergence of the algorithm to the largest RCIS as the iterations proceed to infinity. Based on the developed algorithms, an algorithm to compute inner approximations of the RCIS is also presented. A special case of input affine and disturbance affine systems is also considered. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

abstract = {This paper describes a general passivity-based framework for the control of flexible joint robots. Recent results on torque, position, as well as impedance control of flexible joint robots are summarized, and the relations between the individual contributions are highlighted. It is shown that an inner torque feedback loop can be incorporated into a passivity-based analysis by interpreting torque feedback in terms of shaping of the motor inertia. This result, which implicitly was already included in earlier work on torque and position control, can also be used for the design of impedance controllers. For impedance control, furthermore, potential energy shaping is of special interest. It is shown how, based only on the motor angles, a potential function can be designed which simultaneously incorporates gravity compensation and a desired Cartesian stiffness relation for the link angles. All the presented controllers were experimentally evaluated on DLR lightweight robots and their performance and robustness shown with respect to uncertain model parameters. Experimental results with position controllers as well as an impact experiment are presented briefly, and an overview of several applications is given in which the controllers have been applied.},

abstract = {Fig. 1. A selection of results using our method of character control to traverse rough terrain: the character automatically produces appropriate and expressive locomotion according to the real-time user control and the geometry of the environment. We present a real-time character control mechanism using a novel neural network architecture called a Phase-Functioned Neural Network. In this network structure, the weights are computed via a cyclic function which uses the phase as an input. Along with the phase, our system takes as input user controls, the previous state of the character, the geometry of the scene, and automatically produces high quality motions that achieve the desired user control. The entire network is trained in an end-to-end fashion on a large dataset composed of locomotion such as walking, running, jumping, and climbing movements fitted into virtual environments. Our system can therefore automatically produce motions where the character adapts to different geometric environments such as walking and running over rough terrain, climbing over large rocks, jumping over obstacles, and crouching under low ceilings. Our network architecture produces higher quality results than time-series autoregressive models such as LSTMs as it deals explicitly with the latent variable of motion relating to the phase. Once trained, our system is also extremely fast and compact, requiring only milliseconds of execution time and a few megabytes of memory, even when trained on gigabytes of motion data. Our work is most appropriate for controlling characters in interactive scenes such as computer games and virtual reality systems.},

The proposed framework addresses the problem by bilevel optimization. Specifically, the original problem is divided into an inner layer, which computes a time-optimal velocity profile along a fixed geometric path, and an outer layer, which refines the geometric path by a Quasi-Newton method. The inner optimization is convex and efficiently solved by interior-point methods. A novel variable reordering method is introduced to accelerate the optimization of the velocity profile. The gradients of the outer layer can be derived from the Lagrange multipliers using sensitivity analysis of parametric optimization problems. The method is guaranteed to return a feasible solution at any time, and numerical experiments on a ground vehicle with friction circle dynamics model show that the proposed method performs more robustly than general NLP solvers.},

In some cases, whole body motions may be necessary to maneuver around an obstacle, but most existing footstep planners can only select from a discrete set of predetermined footstep actions, they are unable to utilize the continuum of whole body motion that is truly available to the robot platform. Existing motion planners that can utilize whole body motion tend to struggle with the complexity of large-scale problems. We introduce a planning method, called the "Possibility Graph", which uses high-level approximations of constraint manifolds to rapidly explore the "possibility" of actions, thereby allowing lower-level motion planners to be utilized more efficiently. We demonstrate simulations of the method working in a variety of semi-unstructured environments. In this context, "semi-unstructured" means the walkable terrain is flat and even, but there are arbitrary 3D obstacles throughout the environment which may need to be stepped over or maneuvered around using whole body motions.},

Available : Hongkai Retrieved : 02 Abstract— In this paper , we present a convex optimization problem to generate Center of Mass (CoM) and momentum trajectories of a walking robot , such that the motion robustly satisfies the friction cone constraints on uneven terrain . We adopt the Contact Wrench Cone (CWC) criterion to measure a robot ' s dynamical stability , which generalizes the venerable Zero Moment Point (ZMP) criterion . Unlike the ZMP criterion , which is ideal for walking on flat ground with unbounded tangential friction forces , the CWC criterion incorporates non - coplanar contacts with friction cone constraints . We measure the robustness of the motion using the margin in the Contact Wrench Cone at each time instance , which quantifies the capa - bility of the robot to instantaneously resist external force / torque disturbance , without causing the foot to tip over or slide . For pre - specified footstep location and time , we formulate a convex optimization problem to search for robot linear and angular momenta that satisfy the CWC criterion . We aim to maximize the CWC margin to improve the robustness of the motion , and minimize the centroidal angular momentum (angular momen - tum about CoM) to make the motion natural . Instead of directly minimizing the non - convex centroidal angular momentum , we resort to minimizing a convex upper bound . We show that our CWC planner can generate motion similar to the result of the ZMP planner on flat ground with sufficient friction . Moreover , on an uneven terrain course with friction cone constraints , our CWC planner can still find feasible motion , while the outcome of the ZMP planner violates the friction limit .},

In particular, we investigate how model uncertainty in the time derivative of a CBF can be reduced via learning, and how this leads to stronger statements on the safe behavior of a system. To this end, we build upon the idea of Input-to-State Safety (ISSf) to define Projection-to-State Safety (PSSf), which characterizes degradation in safety in terms of a projected disturbance. This enables the direct quantification of both how learning can improve safety guarantees, and how bounds on learning error translate to bounds on degradation in safety. We demonstrate that a practical episodic learning approach can use PSSf to reduce uncertainty and improve safety guarantees in simulation and experimentally.},

abstract = {This paper explores the benefits of using multiple gaits in a single robot. Inspired by nature, where humans and animals use different gaits to increase their energetic economy, we analyzed how increasing speed affects the choice of gait, and how the choice of gait influences optimal speed. To this end, we used optimal control as a tool to identify motions that minimize the cost of transport of two detailed models: a planar biped and a planar quadruped. Both of these models are actuated with high compliance series elastic actuators that enable a rich set of natural dynamics. These models have damping in their springs, feet with mass, and realistic limitations on actuator torques and velocities. They therefore serve as an intermediary between past simpler models and hardware. We discovered optimal motions with an established multiple shooting implementation that relies on pre-defined contact sequences, and with a direct collocation implementation in which the footfall pattern was an outcome of the optimization. Both algorithms confirmed findings from biology. For both models, changing gaits as speed varies leads to greatly increased energetic economy. For bipeds, the optimal gaits were walking at low speeds, grounded running at intermediate speeds, and running at high speeds. For quadrupeds, the optimal gaits were four-beat walking at low speeds and trotting at intermediate speeds. At high speeds, galloping and trotting were the best gaits, with nearly equal performance. We found that the transition between gaits was primarily driven by damping losses and negative actuator work, with collisions playing a relatively small role.},

This is done by combining the advantages of recursive estimation and fixed-lag smoothing: at each step we re-estimate the trajectory over a time window into the past, but also use a recursive prior obtained from the previous time step via internal simulation. We also incorporate a physics engine into the estimator, which makes it possible to adjust the state estimates so that the inferred contact interactions are consistent with the observed accelerations. The estimator can utilize contact sensors to improve accuracy, but even in the absence of such sensors it reasons correctly about contact forces. Estimation speed and accuracy are demonstrated on a 28-DOF humanoid robot (Darwin) in a walking task. Timing tests and leave-one-out cross-validation show that the proposed approach can be used in real-time and is substantially more accurate than the EKF, without any over-fitting.

We reformulate stiffly–accurate exponential Runge–Kutta methods in a way that naturally allows of the structure of multiphysics systems, and discuss their application to both component and additively partitioned systems. The resulting partitioned exponential methods only compute matrix functions of the Jacobians of individual components, rather than the Jacobian of the full, coupled system. We derive modified formulations of particular methods of order two, three and four, and apply them to solve a partitioned reaction-diffusion problem. The proposed methods retain full order for several partitionings of the discretized problem, including by components and by physical processes.},

Here, we present a method for applying sums-of-squares verification to rigid bodies with Coulomb friction undergoing discontinuous, inelastic impact events. The proposed algorithm explicitly generates Lyapunov certificates for stability, positive invariance, and reachability over admissible (non-penetrating) states and contact forces. We leverage the complementarity formulation of contact, which naturally generates the semialgebraic constraints that define this admissible region. The approach is demonstrated on multiple robotics examples, including simple models of a walking robot and a perching aircraft.},

It surveys the general formulation, terminology, and typical experimental implementations of reinforcement learning and reviews competing solution paradigms. In order to compare the relative merits of various techniques, this survey presents a case study of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with unknown dynamics, perhaps the simplest and best-studied problem in optimal control. The manuscript describes how merging techniques from learning theory and control can provide non-asymptotic characterizations of LQR performance and shows that these characterizations tend to match experimental behavior. In turn, when revisiting more complex applications, many of the observed phenomena in LQR persist. In particular, theory and experiment demonstrate the role and importance of models and the cost of generality in reinforcement learning algorithms. This survey concludes with a discussion of some of the challenges in designing learning systems that safely and reliably interact with complex and uncertain environments and how tools from reinforcement learning and control might be combined to approach these challenges.},

One key feature of pyomo.dae is that it does not restrict users to standard, predefined forms of differential equations, providing a high degree of modeling flexibility and the ability to express constraints that cannot be easily specified in other modeling frameworks. Other key features of pyomo.dae are the ability to specify optimization problems with high-order differential equations and partial differential equations, defined on restricted domain types, and the ability to automatically transform high-level abstract models into finite-dimensional algebraic problems that can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers. Moreover, pyomo.dae users can leverage existing capabilities of Pyomo to embed differential equation models within stochastic and integer programming models and mathematical programs with equilibrium constraint formulations. Collectively, these features enable the exploration of new modeling concepts, discretization schemes, and the benchmarking of state-of-the-art optimization solvers.},

For this purpose, a torsional spring-loaded flywheel model is presented to encapsulate both approximated angular momentum and variable physical stiffness, which are crucial parameters in describing the postural balance. In particular, the incorporation of physical compliance enables us to provide three main contributions: i) A mathematical formulation is developed to express the relation between the dynamic balance criterion ZMP and the physical ankle joint stiffness. Therefore, balancing control can be interpreted in terms of ankle joint stiffness regulation. ii) 'Variable physical' stiffness is utilized in the bipedal robot balance control task for the first time in the literature, to the authors' knowledge. iii) The variable physical stiffness strategy is compared with the optimal constant stiffness strategy by conducting experiments on our exoskeleton robot. The results indicate that the proposed method provides a favorable balancing control performance to cope with unperceived perturbations, in terms of center of mass position regulation, ZMP error and mechanical power.},

abstract = {We tackle the question of whether an agent can, by suitable choice of prompts, control an AI bot to any state. To that end, we first introduce a formal definition of ``meaning'' that is amenable to analysis. Then, we characterize ``meaningful data'' on which large language models (LLMs) are ostensibly trained, and ``well-trained LLMs'' through conditions that are largely met by today's LLMs. While a well-trained LLM constructs an embedding space of meanings that is Euclidean, meanings themselves do not form a vector (linear) subspace, but rather a quotient space within. We then characterize the subset of meanings that can be reached by the state of the LLMs for some input prompt, and show that a well-trained bot can reach any meaning albeit with small probability. We then introduce a stronger notion of controllability as {\em almost certain reachability}, and show that, when restricted to the space of meanings, an AI bot is controllable. We do so after introducing a functional characterization of attentive AI bots, and finally derive necessary and sufficient conditions for controllability. The fact that AI bots are controllable means that an adversary could steer them towards any state. However, the sampling process can be designed to counteract adverse actions and avoid reaching undesirable regions of state space before their boundary is crossed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. Legged robots are typically in rigid contact with the environment at multiple locations, which add a degree of complexity to their control. We present a method to control the motion and a subset of the contact forces of a floating-base robot. We derive a new formulation of the lexicographic optimization problem typically arising in multi-task motion/force control frameworks. The structure of the constraints of the problem (i.e. the dynamics of the robot) allows us to find a sparse analytical solution. This leads to an equivalent optimization with reduced computational complexity, comparable to inverse-dynamics based approaches. At the same time, our method preserves the flexibility of optimization based control frameworks. Simulations were carried out to achieve different multi-contact behaviors on a 23-degree-of-freedom humanoid robot, validating the presented approach. A comparison with another state-of-the-art control technique with similar computational complexity shows the benefits of our controller, which can eliminate force/torque discontinuities.},

We present two real-time DCM trajectory generators for uneven (three-dimensional) ground surfaces, which lead to continuous leg (and corresponding ground reaction) force profiles and facilitate the use of toe-off motion during double support. Thus, the resulting DCM trajectories are well suited for real-world robots and allow for increased step length and height. The performance of the proposed methods was tested in numerous simulations and experiments on IHMC's Atlas robot and DLR's humanoid robot TORO.},

If the terrain is flat, the CM must lie above the convex hull of the robot's feet. If the terrain is not flat, this often-used approximation can be arbitrarily bad. Instead, the CM must lie above the projection of a nonlinear convex set that is defined by the properties of each foot placement. This paper presents an algorithm to compute the shape of this projection and gives a tight bound on the algorithm's running time. It also presents a method of amortizing the cost of this computation when it is only necessary to test static equilibrium at particular CM positions--that is, when it is only necessary to test the membership of points in the projection of a convex set rather than find its shape.},

abstract = {Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at following a user's intent. For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.},

Using a previous work on online trajectory generation as a basis, this paper proposes an alternative approach that also considers dynamic models. The former class of algorithms does not take into account dynamically changing acceleration capabilities based on maximum actuator forces/torques. This paper extends target velocity-based algorithms of the previous approach by taking into consideration the entire system dynamics when generating trajectories online within one control cycle (typically 1 ms or less). The extension includes the acceleration capabilities of a robot at every discrete time step assuming constant values for the maximum actuator forces/torques, thus allowing the generation of adaptive trajectory profiles during the motion of the robot. Several real-world experimental results using a seven-degree-of-freedom lightweight robot arm underline the relevance of this extension.},

From cradle to grave, one is supported by and depends on a wide range of electronic and robotic appliances, with an ever more intimate integration of the digital and biological spheres. These advances, however, often come at the price of negatively impacting our ecosystem, with growing demands on energy, contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution—from production to improper disposal. Mitigating these adverse effects is among the grand challenges of the society and at the forefront of materials research. The currently emerging forms of soft, biologically inspired electronics and robotics have the unique potential of becoming not only like their natural antitypes in performance and capabilities, but also in terms of their ecological footprint. This review outlines the rise of sustainable materials in soft and bioinspired robotics, targeting all robotic components from actuators to energy storage and electronics. The state-of-the-art in biobased robotics spans flourishing fields and applications ranging from microbots operating in vivo to biohybrid machines and fully biodegradable yet resilient actuators.

Along the way, we cover basic debugging strategies and guidelines for posing well-behaved optimization problems. The paper concludes with a short overview of other methods for trajectory optimization. We also provide an electronic supplement that contains well-documented Matlab code for all examples and methods presented in this paper. Our primary goal is to provide the reader with the resources necessary to understand and successfully implement their own direct collocation methods.},

abstract = {In this paper relations between model predictive control and reinforcement learning are studied for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems with state and input constraints and a quadratic value function. The principles of model predictive control and reinforcement learning are reviewed in a tutorial manner. From model predictive control theory it is inferred that the optimal value function is piecewise quadratic on polyhedra and that the optimal policy is piecewise affine on polyhedra. Various ideas for exploiting the knowledge on the structure and the properties of the optimal value function and the optimal policy in reinforcement learning theory and practice are presented. The ideas can be used for deriving stability and feasibility criteria and for accelerating the learning process which can facilitate reinforcement learning for systems with high order, fast dynamics, and strict safety requirements.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the role of precise estimation of contact points in force control. This analysis is motivated by scenarios in which robots make contacts, either voluntarily or accidentally, with different parts of their body. Control paradigms that are usually implemented in robots with no tactile system, make the hypothesis that contacts occur at the end-effectors only. In this paper we try to investigate what happens when this assumption is not verified. First we consider a simple feedforward force control law, and then we extend it by introducing a proportional feedback term. For both controllers we find the error in the resulting contact force, that is induced by a hypothetic error in the estimation of the contact point. We show that, depending on the geometry of the contact, incorrect estimation of contact points can induce undesired joint accelerations. We validate the presented analysis with tests on a simulated robot arm. Moreover we consider a complex real world scenario, where most of the assumptions that we make in our analytical derivation do not hold. Through tests on the iCub humanoid robot we see how errors in contact localization affect the performance of a parallel force/position controller. In order to estimate contact points and contact forces on the forearm of the iCub we do not use any model of the environment, but we exploit its 6-axis force/torque sensor and its sensorized skin. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Towards this goal, we present an interactive computational design system that enables users to design legged robots with desired morphologies and behaviors by specifying higher level descriptions. The core of our method is a design optimization technique that reasons about the structure, and motion of a robot in coupled manner in order to achieve user-specified robot behavior, and performance. We are inspired by the recent works that also aim to jointly optimize robot's form and function. However, through efficient computation of necessary design changes, our approach enables us to keep user-in-the-loop for interactive applications. We evaluate our system in simulation by automatically improving robot designs for multiple scenarios. Starting with initial user designs that are physically infeasible or inadequate to perform the user-desired task, we show optimized designs that achieve user-specifications, all while ensuring an interactive design flow.},

This allows us to construct a novel algorithm for accurate frictional contact resolution based on a simple staggered sequence of projections. The algorithm accelerates performance using warm starts to leverage the potentially high temporal coherence between contact states and provides users with direct control over frictional accuracy. Applying this algorithm to rigid and deformable systems, we obtain robust and accurate simulations of frictional contact behavior not previously possible, at rates suitable for interactive haptic simulations, as well as large-scale animations. By construction, the proposed algorithm guarantees exact, velocity-level contact constraint enforcement and obtains long-term stable and robust integration. Examples are given to illustrate the performance, plausibility and accuracy of the obtained solutions.},

abstract = {We present a method for training recurrent neural networks to act as near-optimal feedback controllers. It is able to generate stable and realistic behaviors for a range of dynamical systems and tasks – swimming, flying, biped and quadruped walking with different body morphologies. It does not require motion capture or task-specific features or state machines. The controller is a neural network, having a large number of feed-forward units that learn elaborate state-action mappings, and a small number of recurrent units that implement memory states beyond the physical system state. The action generated by the network is defined as velocity. Thus the network is not learning a control policy, but rather the dynamics under an implicit policy. Essential features of the method include interleaving supervised learning with trajectory optimization, injecting noise during training, training for unexpected changes in the task specification, and using the trajectory optimizer to obtain optimal feedback gains in addition to optimal actions. Figure 1: Illustration of the dynamical systems and tasks we have been able to control using the same method and architecture. See the video accompanying the submission.},

abstract = {This paper is about a novel set based computing method, called interval superposition arithmetic, for enclosing the image set of multivariate factorable functions on a given domain. In order to represent enclosure sets, the proposed arithmetic stores a matrix of intervals. Every point in the domain is associated with a sequence of interval valued components of this matrix and the superposition, i.e., the Minkowski sum, over these components is the actual enclosure of the function at this point. Interval superposition arithmetic has polynomial runtime complexity with respect to the number of variables of the factorable function. It is capable of representing highly complex enclosure sets, because the number of choices for picking a sequence of components from a given interval matrix grows exponentially with respect to the size of the matrix. The composition rules that are associated with interval superposition arithmetic exploit algebraic addition theorems of atom operations as well as partially separable sub-structures of the computational graph of factorable functions. Besides analyzing the accuracy and favorable convergence properties of interval superposition arithmetic, this paper illustrates the advantages of the proposed method compared to existing set arithmetics by studying numerical examples.},

For this purpose, we utilize the structure of an input-ouput linearization controller based on a nominal model along with a Control Barrier Function and Control Lyapunov Function based Quadratic Program (CBF-CLF-QP). Specifically, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework which learns the model uncertainty present in the CBF and CLF constraints, as well as other control-affine dynamic constraints in the quadratic program. The trained policy is combined with the nominal modelbased CBF-CLF-QP, resulting in the Reinforcement Learning-based CBF-CLF-QP (RL-CBF-CLF-QP), which addresses the problem of model uncertainty in the safety constraints. The performance of the proposed method is validated by testing it on an underactuated nonlinear bipedal robot walking on randomly spaced stepping stones with one step preview, obtaining stable and safe walking under model uncertainty.},

It can be reformulated as a tractable program by using the conic duality of moment problems and an extension of the RKHS representer theorem. Our insights reveal that universal RKHSs are large enough for K-DRO to be effective.

abstract = {We present a novel approach for incorporating collision avoidance into trajectory optimization as a method of solving robotic motion planning problems. At the core of our approach are (i) A sequential convex optimization procedure, which penalizes collisions with a hinge loss and increases the penalty coefficients in an outer loop as necessary. (ii) An efficient formulation of the no-collisions constraint that directly considers continuous-time safety and enables the algorithm to reliably solve motion planning problems, including problems involving thin and complex obstacles. We benchmarked our algorithm against several other mo- tion planning algorithms, solving a suite of 7-degree-of-freedom (DOF) arm-planning problems and 18-DOF full-body planning problems. We compared against sampling-based planners from OMPL, and we also compared to CHOMP, a leading approach for trajectory optimization. Our algorithm was faster than the alternatives, solved more problems, and yielded higher quality paths. Experimental evaluation on the following additional problem types also confirmed the speed and effectiveness of our approach: (i) Planning foot placements with 34 degrees of freedom (28 joints + 6 DOF pose) of the Atlas humanoid robot as it maintains static stability and has to negotiate environmental constraints. (ii) Industrial box picking. (iii) Real-world motion planning for the PR2 that requires considering all degrees of freedom at the same time.},

abstract = {In this lecture the group of rigid body motions is introduced via its representation on standard three dimensional Euclidian space. The relevance for robotics is that the links of a robot are usually modelled as rigid bodies. Moreover the payload of a robot is also usually a rigid body and hence much of robotics is concerned with understanding rigid transformations and sequences of these transformations. Chasles's theorem is presented, that is: a general rigid body motion is a screw motion, a rotation about a line in space followed by a translation along the line. The lower Reuleaux pairs are introduced. These are essentially surfaces which are invariant under some subgroup of rigid body motions. Such a surface can be the matting surface for a mechanical joint. In this way the basic mechanical joints used in robots can be classified. These surfaces turn out to have other applications in robotics. In robot gripping they are exactly the surfaces that cannot be immobilised using frictionless fingers. In robot vision the symmetries of these surfaces are motions which cannot be detected. Next Lie algebras are introduced. The 1-parameter rigid motions about a joint are considered. The correspondence between elements of the Lie algebra and 1-degree-of-freedom joints is given. The exponential map from the Lie algebra to the group is defined and used to describe the forward kinematics of a serial robot using the product of exponentials formula. The Rodrigues formula for the exponential map is derived using a set of mutually annihilating idempotents. The derivative of the exponential map is explored. In particular the Jacobian matrix for the forward kinematics is derived. More general results are also derived and these are used to show how the inverse kinematics problem can be cast as a set of ordinary differential equations.},

abstract = {This paper presents a momentum-based reactive stepping controller for humanoid robot push recovery. By properly regulating combinations of linear and angular momenta, the controller can selectively encourage the robot to recover its balance with or without taking a step. A reference stepping location is computed by modeling the humanoid as a passive rimless wheel with two spokes such that stepping on the location leads to a complete stop of the wheel at the vertically upright position. In contrast to most reference points for stepping based on pendulum models such as the capture point, our reference point exists on both level and non-level grounds. Moreover, in contrast with continuously evolving step locations, our step location is stationary. The computation of the location of the reference point also generates the duration of step which can be used for designing a stepping trajectory. Momentum-based stepping for push recovery is implemented in simulations of a full size humanoid on 3D non-level ground.},

abstract = {Control barrier functions are mathematical constructs used to guarantee safety for robotic systems. When integrated as constraints in a quadratic programming optimization problem, instantaneous control synthesis with real-time performance demands can be achieved for robotics applications. Prevailing use has assumed full knowledge of the safety barrier functions, however there are cases where the safe regions must be estimated online from sensor measurements. In these cases, the corresponding barrier function must be synthesized online. This paper describes a learning framework for estimating control barrier functions from sensor data. Doing so affords system operation in unknown state space regions without compromising safety. Here, a support vector machine classifier provides the barrier function specification as determined by sets of safe and unsafe states obtained from sensor measurements. Theoretical safety guarantees are provided. Experimental ROS-based simulation results for an omnidirectional robot equipped with LiDAR demonstrate safe operation.},

abstract = {The spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) has been extensively studied and used as a model capturing general aspects of legged locomotion. Biological data suggest that legs regulate energy production and removal via muscle activation; therefore, the conservative SLIP model cannot fully explain the robustness of many legged animals during running and hopping gaits. In this work we consider the active SLIP model: an energetically nonconservative version of the SLIP model with added series actuation. In particular, we propose a partial feedback linearization action for actuator displacement to analytically solve part of its dynamics, thereby reducing computational time and increasing the practicality of performing online control actions. This is then paired with a two-part control action to add/remove energy to/from the system and modify the upcoming apex state to span an open set within the reachable apex states. In addition, we develop two control strategies for online computation of actuator displacement and leg positioning: one to drive the system to a desired state, even in the presence of terrain perturbation, and the other to control the system to hop on a desired set of terrain footholds. Furthermore, we demonstrate the proposed strategy on a more dynamically sophisticated planar hopper model.},

One of the salient attributes of the algorithm is the good conditioning of the Jacobian matrix associated with the implicit integrator. Error estimation, integration step-size control, and nonlinear system stopping criteria are discussed in detail.

abstract = {We introduce the Control Toolbox (CT), an open-source C++ library for efficient modeling, control, estimation, trajectory optimization and Model Predictive Control. The CT is applicable to a broad class of dynamic systems but features interfaces to modeling tools specifically designed for robotic applications. This paper outlines the general concept of the toolbox, its main building blocks, and highlights selected application examples. The library contains several tools to design and evaluate controllers, model dynamical systems and solve optimal control problems. The CT was designed for intuitive modeling of systems governed by ordinary differential or difference equations. It supports rapid prototyping of cost functions and constraints and provides standard interfaces for different optimal control solvers. To date, we support Single Shooting, the iterative Linear-Quadratic Regulator, Gauss-Newton Multiple Shooting and classical Direct Multiple Shooting. We provide interfaces to general purpose NLP solvers and Riccati-based linear-quadratic optimal control solvers. The CT was designed to solve large-scale optimal control and estimation problems efficiently and allows for online control of dynamic systems. Some of the key features to enable fast run-time performance are full compatibility with Automatic Differentiation, derivative code generation, and multi-threading. Still, the CT is designed as a modular framework whose building blocks can also be used for other control and estimation applications such as inverse dynamics control, extended Kalman filters or kinematic planning.},

@article{Fogassi1996,
abstract = {1. We studied the functional properties of neurons in the caudal part of inferior area 6 (area F4) in awake monkeys. In agreement with previous reports, we found that the large majority (87%) of neurons responded to sensory stimuli. The responsive neurons fell into three categories: somatosensory neurons (30%); visual neurons (14%); and bimodal, visual and somatosensory neurons (56%). Both somatosensory and bimodal neurons typically responded to light touch of the skin. Their RFs were located on the face, neck, trunk, and arms. Approaching objects were the most effective visual stimuli. Visual RFs were mostly located in the space near the monkey (peripersonal space). Typically they extended in the space adjacent to the tactile RFs. 2. The coordinate system in which visual RFs were coded was studied in 110 neurons. In 94 neurons the RF location was independent of eye position, remaining in the same position in the peripersonal space regardless of eye deviation. The RF location with respect to the monkey was not modified by changing monkey position in the recording room. In 10 neurons the RF's location followed the eye movements, remaining in the same retinal position (retinocentric RFs). For the remaining six neurons the RF organization was not clear. We will refer to F4 neurons with RF independent of eye position as somatocentered neurons. 3. In most somatocentered neurons (43 of 60 neurons) the background level of activity and the response to visual stimuli were not modified by changes in eye position, whereas they were modulated in the remaining 17. It is important to note that eye deviations were constantly accompanied by a synergic increase of the activity of the ipsilateral neck muscles. It is not clear, therefore, whether the modulation of neuron discharge depended on eye position or was a consequence of changes in neck muscle activity. 4. The effect of stimulus velocity (20-80 cm/s) on neuron response intensity and RF extent in depth was studied in 34 somatocentered neurons. The results showed that in most neurons the increase of stimulus velocity produced an expansion in depth of the RF. 5. We conclude that space is coded differently in areas that control somatic and eye movements. We suggest that space coding in different cortical areas depends on the computational necessity of the effectors they control.},

abstract = {Learning-based methods have been successful in solving complex control tasks without significant prior knowledge about the system. However, these methods typically do not provide any safety guarantees, which prevents their use in safety-critical, real-world applications. In this paper, we present a learning-based model predictive control scheme that can provide provable high-probability safety guarantees. To this end, we exploit regularity assumptions on the dynamics in terms of a Gaussian process prior to construct provably accurate confidence intervals on predicted trajectories. Unlike previous approaches, we do not assume that model uncertainties are independent. Based on these predictions, we guarantee that trajectories satisfy safety constraints. Moreover, we use a terminal set constraint to recursively guarantee the existence of safe control actions at every iteration. In our experiments, we show that the resulting algorithm can be used to safely and efficiently explore and learn about dynamic systems.},

@article{Aswani2013,
abstract = {Controller design faces a trade-off between robustness and performance, and the reliability of linear controllers has caused many practitioners to focus on the former. However, there is renewed interest in improving system performance to deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guarantees on robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identify richer models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits of this framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizes system performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to use a wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The main insight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled under reasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models of the system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty, and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improves performance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned dynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same inputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC control action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the true dynamics. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The necessary conditions for stable\ndynamic walking on irregular terrain in general are proposed, and\nthe neural system is designed by comparing biological concepts with\nthose necessary conditions described in physical terms. A PD-controller\nis used at joints to construct a virtual spring{\~{A}}¢{\^{a}}‚¬{\^{a}}€�damper system\nas the visco-elasticity model of a muscle. The neural system model\nconsists of a CPG (central pattern generator), responses and reflexes.\nA response directly and quickly modulates the CPG phase, and a reflex\ndirectly generates joint torque. The state of the virtual spring{\~{A}}¢{\^{a}}‚¬{\^{a}}€�damper\nsystem is switched, based on the CPG phase. In order to make a self-contained\nquadruped (called Tekken2) walk on natural ground, several new reflexes\nand responses are developed in addition to those developed in previous\nstudies. A flexor reflex prevents a leg from stumbling on small bumps\nand pebbles. A sideways stepping reflex stabilizes rolling motion\non a sideways inclined slope. A corrective stepping reflex/response\nprevents the robot from falling down in the case of loss of ground\ncontact. A crossed flexor reflex helps a swinging leg keep enough\nclearance between the toe and the ground. The effectiveness of the\nproposed neural system model control and especially the newly developed\nreflexes and responses are validated by indoor and outdoor experiments\nusing Tekken2. A CPG receives sensory feedback as a result of motions\ninduced by reflexes, and changes the period of its own active phase.\nSince a CPG has the ability of mutual entrainment with pitching motion\nof legs and rolling motion of the body in addition, the consistency\nbetween motion of a leg temporally modified by a reflex and motions\nof the other legs is maintained autonomously. It is shown that CPGs\ncan be the center of sensorimotor coordination, and that the neural\nsystem model simply defining the relationships between CPGs, sensory\ninput, reflexes and mechanical system works very well even in complicated\ntasks such as adaptive dynamic walking on unstructured natural ground.\n},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Maintaining equilibrium is of primary importance for legged systems. It is not surprising then that static equilibrium is at the core of most control/planning algorithms for legged robots. Being able to check whether a system is in static equilibrium is thus important, and doing it efficiently is crucial. While this is straightforward for a system in contact with a flat ground only, it is not the case for arbitrary contact geometries. In this paper we propose two new techniques to test static equilibrium and we show that they are computationally faster than all other existing methods. Moreover, we address the issue of robustness to errors in the contact-force tracking, which could lead to slippage or rotation at the contacts. We extend all the discussed techniques to test for robust static equilibrium, that is the ability to maintain equilibrium while avoiding to lose contacts despite bounded force-tracking errors. Accounting for robustness does not affect the computation time of the equilibrium tests, while it qualitatively improves the contact postures generated by our reachability-based multicontact planner.},

A novel data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) algorithm is presented that computes optimal and safe control policies using real-time feedback driving the unknown system along a desired trajectory while satisfying system constraints. Using a finite number of data samples from the unknown system, our proposed algorithm uses a behavioural systems theory approach to learn a non-parametric system model used to predict future trajectories. The DeePC algorithm is shown to be equivalent to the classical and widely adopted Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm in the case of deterministic linear time-invariant systems. In the case of nonlinear stochastic systems, we propose regularizations to the DeePC algorithm. Simulations are provided to illustrate performance and compare the algorithm with other methods.},

abstract = {Reduced-order models (ROM) are popular in online motion planning due to their simplicity. A good ROM captures the bulk of the full model's dynamics while remaining low dimension. However, planning within the reduced-order space unavoidably constrains the full model, and hence we sacrifice the full potential of the robot. In the community of legged locomotion, this has lead to a search for better model extensions, but many of these extensions require human intuition, and there has not existed a principled way of evaluating the model performance and discovering new models. In this work, we propose a model optimization algorithm that automatically synthesizes reduced-order models, optimal with respect to any user-specified cost function. To demonstrate our work, we optimized models for a bipedal robot Cassie. We show in hardware experiment that the optimal ROM is simple enough for real time planning application and that the real robot achieves higher performance by using the optimal ROM.},

The method is based on the combination of a model-based policy that is trained off-line in simulation and sends high-level commands to a model-free controller that executes these commands on the physical robot. This low-level controller simultaneously learns and adapts a local model of dynamics on-line and computes optimal controls under the learned model. The high-level policy is trained using a combination of trajectory optimization and neural network learning, while considering physical limitations such as limited sensors and communication delays. The entire system runs in real-time on the robot's computer and uses only on-board sensors. We demonstrate successful policy execution on a range of tasks such as leaning, hand reaching, and robust balancing behaviors atop a tilting base on the physical robot and in simulation.},

Meanwhile, their inherent sample efficiency warrants utility for most robot applications, limiting potential damage to the robot and its environment during training. Inspired by information theoretic model predictive control and advances in deep reinforcement learning, we introduce Model Predictive Actor-Critic (MoPAC)†, a hybrid model-based/model-free method that combines model predictive rollouts with policy optimization as to mitigate model bias. MoPAC leverages optimal trajectories to guide policy learning, but explores via its model-free method, allowing the algorithm to learn more expressive dynamics models. This combination guarantees optimal skill learning up to an approximation error and reduces necessary physical interaction with the environment, making it suitable for real-robot training. We provide extensive results showcasing how our proposed method generally outperforms current state-of-the-art and conclude by evaluating MoPAC for learning on a physical robotic hand performing valve rotation and finger gaiting-a task that requires grasping, manipulation, and then regrasping of an object.},

Conventional engine control units use two SISO control loops to regulate the exhaust gas recirculation valve and the variable geometry turbocharger, although their effects are highly coupled. Moreover, these actuators are subject to physical constraints which seems to make an advanced control approach like model predictive control (MPC) the method of choice. In order to deal with MPC sampling times in the order of milliseconds, we employed an extension of the recently developed online active set strategy for controlling a real-world Diesel engine in a closed-loop manner.

abstract = {This paper proposes a mixed-integer convex programming formulation for dynamic motion planning. Many dynamic constraints such as the actuator torque constraint are nonlinear and non-convex due to the trigonometrical terms from the Jacobian matrix. This often causes the optimization problem to converge to local optima or even infeasible set. In this paper, we convexify the torque constraint by formulating a mixed-integer quadratically-constrained program (MIQCP). More specifically, the workspace is discretized into a union of disjoint polytopes and torque constraint is enforced upon a convex outer approximation of the torque ellipsoid, obtained by solving a semidefinite program (SDP). Bilinear terms are approximated by McCormick envelope convex relaxation. The proposed MIQCP framework could be solved efficiently to global optimum and the generated trajectories could exploit the rich features of the rough terrain without any initial guess from the designer. The demonstrated experiment results prove that this approach is currently capable of planning consecutive jumps that navigates a single-legged robot through challenging terrains.},

abstract = {Legged robots can outperform wheeled machines for most navigation tasks across unknown and rough terrains. For such tasks, visual feedback is a fundamental asset to provide robots with terrain-awareness. However, robust dynamic locomotion on difficult terrains with real-time performance guarantees remains a challenge. Indeed, the computational effort demanded by visual processing limits the potential for realtime control and planning strategies. In this paper, we present a real-time, dynamic foothold adaptation strategy based on visual feedback. Our method adjusts the landing position of the feet in a fully reactive manner, using only on-board computers and sensors. The correction is computed and executed continuously along the swing phase trajectory of each leg. To efficiently adapt the landing position, we implement a self-supervised foothold classifier based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The training set is automatically generated by a heuristic algorithm that jointly evaluates terrain morphology, kinematics, and leg collisions. Our method results in an up to 200 times faster computation with respect to the full-blown heuristics. Our goal is to react to visual stimuli from the environment, bridging the gap between blind reactive locomotion and purely vision-based planning strategies. We assess the performance of our method on the dynamic quadruped robot HyQ, executing static and dynamic gaits (at speeds up to 0.5 m/s) in both simulated and real scenarios; the benefit of safe foothold adaptation is clearly demonstrated by the overall robot behavior.},

@article{Steve2014,
abstract = {A common issue in three-dimensional animation is the creation of contacts between a virtual creature and the environment. Contacts allow force exertion, which produces motion. This paper addresses the problem of computing contact configurations allowing to perform motion tasks such as getting up from a sofa, pushing an object or climbing. We propose a two-step method to generate contact configurations suitable for such tasks. The first step is an offline sampling of the reachable workspace of a virtual creature. The second step is a run time request confronting the samples with the current environment. The best contact configurations are then selected according to a heuristic for task efficiency. The heuristic is inspired by the force transmission ratio. Given a contact configuration, it measures the potential force that can be exerted in a given direction. Our method is automatic and does not require examples or motion capture data. It is suitable for real time applications and applies to arbitrary creatures in arbitrary environments. Various scenarios (such as climbing, crawling, getting up, pushing or pulling objects) are used to demonstrate that our method enhances motion autonomy and interactivity in constrained environments.},

@article{Lidec2022,
abstract = {In the past few years, following the differentiable programming paradigm, there has been a growing interest in computing the gradient information of physical processes (e.g., physical simulation, image rendering). However, such processes may be non-differentiable or yield uninformative gradients (i.d., null almost everywhere). When faced with the former pitfalls, gradients estimated via analytical expression or numerical techniques such as automatic differentiation and finite differences, make classical optimization schemes converge towards poor quality solutions. Thus, relying only on the local information provided by these gradients is often not sufficient to solve advanced optimization problems involving such physical processes, notably when they are subject to non-smoothness and non-convexity issues.In this work, inspired by the field of zero-th order optimization, we leverage randomized smoothing to augment differentiable physics by estimating gradients in a neighborhood. Our experiments suggest that integrating this approach inside optimization algorithms may be fruitful for tasks as varied as mesh reconstruction from images or optimal control of robotic systems subject to contact and friction issues.},

Such a problem can be solved in an efficient way and may be easily modified to include constraints due to obstacles. Here we present further developments of the idea. In particular, for the case of planar robots, we show (i) how to impose hard constraints on the joint angles while preserving the convexity of the problem, and (ii) how to add constraints due to objects (for instance, a load carried by the robot) that are rigidly attached to some part of the robot.},

For calculating the friction force, a new nonlinear model which is able to calculate pre-sliding displacement and viscous friction is presented. It is shown that this model allows us to keep track of all the energy in the system and therefore, supports an energy audit. Also, the rolling motion of a sphere on a compliant ground plane is simulated, and the results are presented. Rolling motion is an integral part of simulating the general 3D motion of a robot's foot while in contact with the ground.},

This paper further extends this approach, ( i ) by explicitly supporting the inclusion of inequality constraints in the task and ( ii ) by supporting a broader class of objective functions for translating the task constraints into robot motion. These extensions are made while retaining a tractable mathematical problem structure (a convex pro- gram). Furthermore, first results on extending the approach to non-instantaneous tasks are presented. As illustrated in the paper, the power of the approach lies ( i ) at its versatility to specify a wide range of robot behaviors and the ease of making task adjustments, and ( ii ) at its generic nature, that permits using systematic procedures to derive the underlying control equations.},

abstract = {Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis has been developed over the past decades into a widely-applicable tool for determining goal satisfaction and safety verification in nonlinear systems. While HJ reachability can be formulated very generally, computational complexity can be a serious impediment for many systems of practical interest. Much prior work has been devoted to computing approximate solutions to large reachability problems, yet many of these methods may only apply to very restrictive problem classes, do not generate controllers, and/or can be extremely conservative. In this paper, we present a new method for approximating the optimal controller of the HJ reachability problem for control-affine systems. While also a specific problem class, many dynamical systems of interest are, or can be well approximated, by control-affine models. We explicitly avoid storing a representation of the reachability value function, and instead learn a controller as a sequence of simple binary classifiers. We compare our approach to existing grid-based methodologies in HJ reachability and demonstrate its utility on several examples, including a physical quadrotor navigation task.},

In the paper, capability of adaptation of the proposed control system to variance of the environment is verified through numerical simulations and hardware experiments. With the input signals from the touch sensors at the tips of the legs, the nonlinear oscillators tune the phase differences among them through mutual entertainments. As a result, a gait pattern corresponding to the states of the system or to the properties of the environment emerges. The robot changes its gait pattern adaptively to variance of the environment and establishes a stable locomotion while suppressing the energy consumption},

The proposed controller formulates the Optimal Control Problem (OCP) in terms of flat outputs over an adaptive lattice. In common approximated OCP solutions, the number of discretization points composing the lattice represents a critical upper bound for real-time applications. The proposed NMPC-based technique refines the initially uniform time horizon by adding time steps with a sampling criterion that aims to reduce the discretization error. This enables a higher accuracy in the initial part of the receding horizon, which is more relevant to NMPC, while keeping bounded the number of discretization points. By combining this feature with an efficient Least Square formulation, our solver is also extremely time-efficient, generating trajectories of multiple seconds within only a few milliseconds. The performance of the proposed approach has been validated in a high fidelity simulation environment, by using an UAV platform. We also released our implementation as open source C++ code.},

Typical policy search methods of this kind minimize a distance metric between the guiding demonstrations and the learned policy. Our loss function, however, corresponds to the minimization of the control Hamiltonian, which derives from the principle of optimality. Therefore, our algorithm directly attempts to solve the optimality conditions with a parameterized class of control laws. Additionally, the proposed loss function explicitly encodes the constraints of the optimal control problem and we provide numerical evidence that its minimization achieves improved constraint satisfaction. We train a mixture-of-expert neural network architecture for controlling a quadrupedal robot and show that this policy structure is well suited for such multimodal systems. The learned policy can successfully stabilize different gaits on the real walking robot from less than 10 min of demonstration data.},

abstract = {Designing controllers for tasks with complex non- linear dynamics is extremely challenging, time-consuming, and in many cases, infeasible. This difficulty is exacerbated in tasks such as robotic food-cutting, in which dynamics might vary both with environmental properties, such as material and tool class, and with time while acting. In this work, we present DeepMPC, an online real-time model-predictive control approach designed to handle such difficult tasks. Rather than hand-design a dynamics model for the task, our approach uses a novel deep architecture and learning algorithm, learning controllers for complex tasks directly from data. We validate our method in experiments on a large-scale dataset of 1488 material cuts for 20 diverse classes, and in 450 real-world robotic experiments, demonstrating significant improvement over several other approaches.},

@article{Yang2016,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel inverse Dynamic Reachability Map (iDRM) that allows a floating base system to find valid end-poses in complex and dynamically changing environments in real-time. End-pose planning for valid stance pose and collision-free configuration is an essential problem for humanoid applications, such as providing goal states for walking and motion planners. However, this is non-trivial in complex environments, where standing locations and reaching postures are restricted by obstacles. Our proposed iDRM customizes the robot-to-workspace occupation list and uses an online update algorithm to enable efficient reconstruction of the reachability map to guarantee that the selected end-poses are always collision-free. The iDRM was evaluated in a variety of reaching tasks using the 38 degree-of-freedom (DoF) humanoid robot Valkyrie. Our results show that the approach is capable of finding valid end-poses in a fraction of a second. Significantly, we also demonstrate that motion planning algorithms integrating our end-pose planning method are more efficient than those not utilizing this technique.},

In particular, a visual system has been used to cope with the problem of unknown objects grasping.

abstract = {— This paper develops a control methodology that unifies control barrier functions and control Lyapunov func-tions through quadratic programs. The result is demonstrated on adaptive cruise control, which presents both safety and performance considerations, as well as actuator bounds. We begin by presenting a novel notion of a barrier function associated with a set, formulated in the context of Lyapunov-like conditions; the existence of a barrier function satisfying these conditions implies forward invariance of the set. This formulation naturally yields a notion of control barrier function (CBF), yielding inequality constraints in the control input that, when satisfied, again imply forward invariance of the set. Through these constructions, CBFs can naturally be unified with control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) in the context of a quadratic program (QP); this allows for the simultaneous achievement of control objectives (represented by CLFs) subject to conditions on the admissible states of the system (represented by CBFs). These formulations are illustrated in the context of adaptive cruise control, where the control objective of achieving a desired speed is balanced by the minimum following condi-tions on a lead car and force-based constraints on acceleration and braking.},

Convex constraints in the decision variables (in particular, linear constraints in the workspace) are easily managed with the proposed approach. We also show how to exploit the idea for avoiding obstacles while tracking a reference end-effector trajectory and discuss how to extend the results to some kinds of non-planar manipulators.

The system uses a common high-level framework to model contact constraints, surface shading, friction and texture. The multilevel control system also helps ensure that the haptic device will remain stable even as the limits of the renderer's capabilities are reached.},

Their definition is based on the smoothness of the re-planned task with respect to the current state of the robot. This allows a deep investigation of the behavior of the method under different conditions. Simulations results on a 7-degree-of-freedom KUKA LWR IV demonstrate remarkable advantages of the predictive method, both in terms of task error and redundancy exploitation.},

abstract = {Dexterous multi-fingered robotic hands represent a promising solution for robotic manipulators to perform a wide range of complex tasks, through acquiring more general purpose skills. Nevertheless, developing complex behaviours for a robot needs sophisticated control strategies, which requires domain expertise with a good understanding of mathematics, and underlying physics, this will be very difficult for such complex robots. Learning algorithms like deep reinforcement learning provide a general framework for robots to learn complex behaviours directly from data. But, even for learning algorithms, dexterous manipulators represent a major challenge due to their high dimensionality and contact rich under-Actuated object manipulation. To overcome these challenges, learning algorithms demand extensive data generation, which is often expensive or hard to obtain. So, the need for more efficient and more effective algorithms-That extract more useful information from the least amount of available data-has increased. This paper presents a contribution which is the development of the algorithm Model Predictive Control-Soft Actor Critic (MPC-SAC), an algorithm that combines offline learning with online planning to develop a control policy. The algorithm is benchmarked on two challenging complex dexterous manipulation tasks, against other state of the art model free reinforcement learning algorithms. Finally, it was found that the algorithm achieves asymptotic performance with state of the art data efficiency in both tasks.},

abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great success in learning complex control policies for a variety of applications in robotics. However, in most such cases, the hardware of the robot has been considered immutable, modeled as part of the environment. In this study, we explore the problem of learning hardware and control parameters together in a unified RL framework. To achieve this, we propose to model the robot body as a "hardware policy", analogous to and optimized jointly with its computational counterpart. We show that, by modeling such hardware policies as auto-differentiable computational graphs, the ensuing optimization problem can be solved efficiently by gradient-based algorithms from the Policy Optimization family. We present two such design examples: a toy mass-spring problem, and a real-world problem of designing an underactuated hand. We compare our method against traditional co-optimization approaches, and also demonstrate its effectiveness by building a physical prototype based on the learned hardware parameters.

abstract = {This work introduces a formulation of model predictive control (MPC) which adaptively reasons about the complexity of the model based on the task while maintaining feasibility and stability guarantees. Existing MPC implementations often handle computational complexity by shortening prediction horizons or simplifying models, both of which can result in instability. Inspired by related approaches in behavioral economics, motion planning, and biomechanics, our method solves MPC problems with a simple model for dynamics and constraints over regions of the horizon where such a model is feasible and a complex model where it is not. The approach leverages an interleaving of planning and execution to iteratively identify these regions, which can be safely simplified if they satisfy an exact template/anchor relationship. We show that this method does not compromise the stability and feasibility properties of the system, and measure performance in simulation experiments on a quadrupedal robot executing agile behaviors over terrains of interest. We find that this adaptive method enables more agile motion and expands the range of executable tasks compared to fixed-complexity implementations.},

In this work, we present a novel method for parallelizing the computation of solutions across multiple processors. As a byproduct of the computation, the method presented generates feedback control policies that are useful when computing solutions to nonlinear optimal control problems and in the control of autonomous systems. The feedback policies generated by this method differ from those generated in existing methods, and the implications and benefits of this difference are discussed through the use of an example.},

abstract = {We propose an automatic and formally sound method for synthesising Lyapunov functions for the asymptotic stability of autonomous non-linear systems. Traditional methods are either analytical and require manual effort or are numerical but lack of formal soundness. Symbolic computational methods for Lyapunov functions, which are in between, give formal guarantees but are typically semi-automatic because they rely on the user to provide appropriate function templates. We propose a method that finds Lyapunov functions fully automatically - using machine learning - while also providing formal guarantees - using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). We employ a counterexample-guided approach where a numerical learner and a symbolic verifier interact to construct provably correct Lyapunov neural networks (LNNs). The learner trains a neural network that satisfies the Lyapunov criteria for asymptotic stability over a samples set; the verifier proves via SMT solving that the criteria are satisfied over the whole domain or augments the samples set with counterexamples. Our method supports neural networks with polynomial activation functions and multiple depth and width, which display wide learning capabilities. We demonstrate our method over several non-trivial benchmarks and compare it favourably against a numerical optimisation-based approach, a symbolic template-based approach, and a cognate LNN-based approach. Our method synthesises Lyapunov functions faster and over wider spatial domains than the alternatives, yet providing stronger or equal guarantees.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first randomized approach to kinodynamic planning (also known as trajectory planning or trajectory design). The task is to determine control inputs to drive a robot froman initial configuration and velocity to a goal configuration and velocity while obeying physically based dynamical models and avoiding obstacles in the robot's environment. The authors consider generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of the robot's high-dimensional configuration space. Kinodynamic planning is treated as a motion-planning problem in a higher dimensional state space that has both first-order differential constraints and obstacle- based global constraints. The state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning; however, standard ran- domized path-planning techniques do not directly apply to planning trajectories in the state space. The authors have developed a ran- domized planning approach that is particularly tailored to trajectory planning problems in high-dimensional state spaces. The basis for this approach is the construction of rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits that are similar to those obtained by success- ful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to a much broader class of problems. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given. Experimental results are presented for an implementation that computes trajectories for hovercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces of up to 12 dimensions.},

abstract = {Neural networks have recently solved many hard problems in Machine Learning, but their impact in control remains limited. Trajectory optimization has recently solved many hard problems in robotic control, but using it online remains challenging. Here we leverage the high-fidelity solutions obtained by trajectory optimization to speed up the training of neural network controllers. The two learning problems are coupled using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). This coupling enables the trajectory optimizer to act as a teacher, gradually guiding the network towards better solutions. We develop a new trajectory optimizer based on inverse contact dynamics, and provide not only the trajectories but also the feedback gains as training data to the network. The method is illustrated on rolling, reaching, swimming and walking tasks.},

A real-time reinforcement learning algorithm is presented that repeatedly adjusts the control policy with the use of previously collected samples, and autonomously estimates the appropriate step-sizes for the learning updates. The algorithm is based on the actor-critic with experience replay whose step-sizes are determined on-line by an enhanced fixed point algorithm for on-line neural network training.

abstract = {We propose a fast second-order method that can be used as a drop-in replacement for current deep learning solvers. Compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), it only requires two additional forward-mode automatic differentiation operations per iteration, which has a computational cost comparable to two standard forward passes and is easy to implement. Our method addresses long-standing issues with current second-order solvers, which invert an approximate Hessian matrix every iteration exactly or by conjugate-gradient methods, procedures that are much slower than a SGD step. Instead, we propose to keep a single estimate of the gradient projected by the inverse Hessian matrix, and update it once per iteration with just two passes over the network. This estimate has the same size and is similar to the momentum variable that is commonly used in {SGD}. No estimate of the Hessian is maintained. We first validate our method, called CurveBall, on small problems with known solutions (noisy Rosenbrock function and degenerate 2-layer linear networks), where current deep learning solvers struggle. We then train several large models on CIFAR and ImageNet, including ResNet and VGG-f networks, where we demonstrate faster convergence with no hyperparameter tuning. We also show our optimiser's generality by testing on a large set of randomly generated architectures.},

abstract = {Traditional motion planning approaches for multilegged locomotion divide the problem into several stages, such as contact search and trajectory generation. However, reasoning about contacts and motions simultaneously is crucial for the generation of complex whole-body behaviors. Currently, coupling theses problems has required either the assumption of a fixed gait sequence and flat terrain condition, or nonconvex optimization with intractable computation time. In this letter, we propose a mixed-integer convex formulation to plan simultaneously contact locations, gait transitions, and motion, in a computationally efficient fashion. In contrast to previous works, our approach is not limited to flat terrain nor to a prespecified gait sequence. Instead, we incorporate the friction cone stability margin, approximate the robot's torque limits, and plan the gait using mixed-integer convex constraints. We experimentally validated our approach on the HyQ robot by traversing different challenging terrains, where nonconvexity and flat terrain assumptions might lead to suboptimal or unstable plans. Our method increases the motion robustness while keeping a low computation time.},

abstract = {The notions of invariant sets and ultimate bounds are important concepts in the analysis of dynamical systems and very useful tools for the design of control systems. Several approaches have been reported for the characterisation of these sets, including constructive methods for their computation and procedures to obtain different approximations. However, there are shortcomings in those concepts, in the sense that no general probability distributions can be considered for the disturbances affecting the system (which, for example, precludes the assumption of Gaussian distributions insofar as they are not bounded). Motivated by those shortcomings, we propose in this paper the novel concepts of probabilistic ultimate bounds and probabilistic invariant sets, which extend the notions of invariant sets and ultimate bounds to consider 'containment in probability', and have the important feature of allowing stochastic noises with more general distributions, including the ubiquitous Gaussian distribution, to be considered. We introduce some key definitions for these sets, establish their main properties and develop methods for their computation.

However, the dynamic properties and their potential utility in the design of robots have been relatively unexplored. This paper introduces robots based on tensegrity structures, which demonstrate that the dynamics of such structures can be utilized for locomotion. Two tensegrity robots are presented: TR3, based on a triangular tensegrity prism with three struts, and TR4, based on a quadrilateral tensegrity prism with four struts. For each of these robots, simulation models are designed, and automatic design of controllers for forward locomotion are performed in simulation using evolutionary algorithms. The evolved controllers are shown to be able to produce static and dynamic gaits in both robots. A real-world tensegrity robot is then developed based on one of the simulation models as a proof of concept. The results demonstrate that tensegrity structures can provide the basis for lightweight, strong, and fault-tolerant robots with a potential for a variety of locomotor gaits},

Different parameters such as integration scheme, number of discretization nodes, initialization strategies and complexity of the problem are evaluated. We measure the performance of the methods in terms of computational time, accuracy and quality of the solution. Additionally, we compare two optimization methodologies frequently used to solve the transcribed problem, namely Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) and Interior Point Method (IPM). As a benchmark, we solve different motion tasks on an underactuated and non-minimal-phase ball-balancing robot with a 10 dimensional state space and 3 dimensional input space. Additionally, we validate the results on a simulated 3D quadrotor. Finally, as a verification of using direct transcription methods for trajectory optimization on real robots, we present hardware experiments on a motion task including path constraints and actuation limits.},

Constraint satisfaction is typically guaranteed through the use of accurate, a priori models or robust control. However, accurate models are generally not available for off-road operation. Furthermore, robust controllers are often conservative, since model uncertainty is not updated online. In this work our goal is to use learning to generate low-uncertainty, non-parametric models in situ. Based on these models, the predictive controller computes both linear and angular velocities in real-time, such that the robot drives at or near its capabilities while respecting path and localization constraints. Localization for the controller is provided by an on-board, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, off-road environments. The paper presents experimental results, including over 5 km of travel by a 900 kg skid-steered robot at speeds of up to 2.0 m/s. The result is a robust, learning controller that provides safe, conservative control during initial trials when model uncertainty is high and converges to high-performance, optimal control during later trials when model uncertainty is reduced with experience.},

abstract = {Simulating frictional contacts remains a challenging research topic in robotics. Recently, differentiable physics emerged and has proven to be a key element in model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) and optimal control fields. However, most of the current formulations deploy coarse approximations of the underlying physical principles. Indeed, the classic simulators loose precision by casting the Nonlinear Complementarity Problem (NCP) of frictional contact into a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) to simplify computations. Moreover, such methods deploy non-smooth operations and cannot be automatically differentiated. In this letter, we propose (i) an extension of the staggered projections algorithm for more accurate solutions of the problem of contacts with friction. Based on this formulation, we introduce (ii) a differentiable simulator and an efficient way to compute the analytical derivatives of the involved optimization problems. Finally, (iii) we validate the proposed framework with a set of experiments to present a possible application of our differentiable simulator. In particular, using our approach we demonstrate accurate estimation of friction coefficients and object masses both in synthetic and real experiments.},

abstract = {We present a new optimization-based approach for robotic motion planning among obstacles. Like CHOMP (Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning), our algorithm can be used to find collision-free trajectories from naive, straight-line initializations that might be in collision. At the core of our approach are (a) a sequential convex optimization procedure, which penalizes collisions with a hinge loss and increases the penalty coefficients in an outer loop as necessary, and (b) an efficient formulation of the no-collisions constraint that directly considers continuous-time safety Our algorithm is implemented in a software package called TrajOpt. We report results from a series of experiments comparing TrajOpt with CHOMP and randomized planners from OMPL, with regard to planning time and path quality. We consider motion planning for 7 DOF robot arms, 18 DOF full-body robots, statically stable walking motion for the 34 DOF Atlas humanoid robot, and physical experiments with the 18 DOF PR2. We also apply TrajOpt to plan curvature-constrained steerable needle trajectories in the SE(3) configuration space and multiple non-intersecting curved channels within 3D-printed implants for intracavitary brachytherapy.

abstract = {Quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) have a wide range of applications in signal processing and wireless communications. Non-convex QCQPs are NP-hard in general. Existing approaches relax the non-convexity using semi-definite relaxation (SDR) or linearize the non-convex part and solve the resulting convex problem. However, these techniques are seldom successful in even obtaining a feasible solution when the QCQP matrices are indefinite. In this paper, a new feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation (FPP-SCA) algorithm is proposed for non-convex QCQPs. FPP-SCA linearizes the non-convex parts of the problem as conventional SCA does, but adds slack variables to sustain feasibility, and a penalty to ensure slacks are sparingly used. When FPP-SCA is successful in identifying a feasible point of the non-convex QCQP, convergence to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point is thereafter ensured. Simulations show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in obtaining feasible and near-optimal solutions, significantly outperforming existing approaches.},

This paper aims to address a few problems regarding risk-aware verification and policy synthesis, by first developing a sample-based method to bound the risk measure evaluation of a random variable whose distribution is unknown. These bounds permit us to generate high-confidence verification statements for a large class of robotic systems. Second, we develop a sample-based method to determine solutions to non-convex optimization problems that outperform a large fraction of the decision space of possible solutions. Both sample-based approaches then permit us to rapidly synthesize risk-aware policies that are guaranteed to achieve a minimum level of system performance. To showcase our approach in simulation, we verify a cooperative multi-agent system and develop a risk-aware controller that outperforms the system's baseline controller. We also mention how our approach can be extended to account for any $g$-entropic risk measure - the subset of coherent risk measures on which we focus.},

abstract = {Fluidic McKibben artificial muscle is one of the best biomimetic actuators, exhibiting static and dynamic behaviour in close analogy with skeletal muscle. It is also known that McKibben muscle can combine this analogical behaviour with a high force on mass and on volume ratio. This paper analyses the working possibility of a small-size McKibben muscle for which a chemical activation mode is substituted in place of pneumatic energy, with the hope of deriving an original actuator for new applications in robotics and medicine. A pH activation mode seems particularly well adapted to our approach due to a large availability of pH-sensitive materials and the ease of reversible control by acid and base flows. The use of ion-exchange resins is considered due to their high swelling ability and ball-like microscopic structure favourable to flow circulation through the inner chamber of the McKibben muscle. The paper reports experimental results of artificial muscles 70-100 mm in length and 8 mm in diameter under isometric and isotonic conditions and against loads between 0.5 and 3 kg. A maximum tension of about 100 N is generated by the use of 0.1N NaOH/HCl solutions, which corresponds to a maximum stress of approximately 500 kN/m2 and is greater than corresponding vertebrate skeletal muscle. We propose adapting the pH-muscle to actuate via ion-exchange in a hydrogel environment in order to overcome the slow response time (>30 min), thus addressing one major drawback of their use in biomimetic robotics. Our preliminary results demonstrate the possibility of using synthesized hydrogel powders in order to generate quicker dynamic responses. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This is achieved by means of an Observability Constrained Extended Kalman Filter that fuses kinematic encoder data with on-board IMU measurements. By including the absolute position of all footholds into the filter state, simple model equations can be formulated which accurately capture the uncertainties associated with the intermittent ground contacts. The resulting filter simultaneously estimates the position of all footholds and the pose of the main body. In the algorithmic formulation, special attention is paid to the consistency of the linearized filter: it maintains the same observability properties as the nonlinear system, which is a prerequisite for accurate state estimation. The presented approach is implemented in simulation and validated experimentally on an actual quadrupedal robot.},

abstract = {Actor-Critics constitute an important class of reinforcement learning algorithms that can deal with continuous actions and states in an easy and natural way. This paper shows how these algorithms can be augmented by the technique of experience replay without degrading their convergence properties, by appropriately estimating the policy change direction. This is achieved by truncated importance sampling applied to the recorded past experiences. It is formally shown that the resulting estimation bias is bounded and asymptotically vanishes, which allows the experience replay-augmented algorithm to preserve the convergence properties of the original algorithm. The technique of experience replay makes it possible to utilize the available computational power to reduce the required number of interactions with the environment considerably, which is essential for real-world applications. Experimental results are presented that demonstrate that the combination of experience replay and Actor-Critics yields extremely fast learning algorithms that achieve successful policies for non-trivial control tasks in considerably short time. Namely, the policies for the cart-pole swing-up [Doya, K. (2000). Reinforcement learning in continuous time and space. Neural Computation, 12(1), 219-245] are obtained after as little as 20 min of the cart-pole time and the policy for Half-Cheetah (a walking 6-degree-of-freedom robot) is obtained after four hours of Half-Cheetah time. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper proposes a reactive leg motion generation method which integrates geometric constraints into its generation process. In order to react given instructions instantaneously or to keep balance against external disturbances, feasible steps must be generated automatically in real-time for safety. In many cases this feasibility has been realized by using predefined steps or admissible stepping regions. However, these predefinitions are often too conservative or valid only in limited situations. The proposed method considers geometric constraints in addition to joint limits during its generation process and it can utilize the ability of the robot to a maximum extent. It can generate feasible walking pattern in real-time by modifying the swing leg motion and the next landing position at each control cycle. The proposed method is validated by experiments using a humanoid robot HRP-2.},

abstract = {— To operate in human environments, robots must be able to withstand external disturbances. Small disturbances can be stabilized through momentum regulation, but larger ones require steps to prevent falling. This work presents two new techniques for disturbance rejection. The first is an extension of divergent component of motion (DCM) and capture point tracking controllers that augments a PI feedback control law with a disturbance observer. This is used to estimate tran-sient disturbances through momentum-rate-of-change error. For larger disturbances, we present a novel optimization-based framework based on the DCM dynamics that uses a quadratic program to compute the desired ground reaction forces and recovery step location. Using optimization gives a flexibility that enables planning angular-momentum-rate-of-change trajectories to help reduce recovery step length. We then illustrate the effectiveness of these methods with hardware and simulation experiments of the THOR humanoid.},

It has been appositely designed for real-time motion applications like those that can be encountered in robotic or mechatronic contexts. The filter generates output signals which are continuous together with their first and second time derivatives. Simultaneously, the first, the second, and the third time derivatives are bounded within freely assignable limits. If such limits are changed on-the-fly, the filter hangs the new bounds in minimum-time. An example case shows the filter while tracking steps, ramps and parabolas by means of bounded-dynamic transients.},

The main limitation of MPC is, however, its online computational complexity. For discrete-time linear time-invariant systems with constraints on inputs and states, we develop an algorithm to determine explicitly the state feedback control law associated with MPC, and show that it is piecewise linear and continuous. The controller inherits all the stability and performance properties of MPC, but the online computation is reduced to a simple linear function evaluation instead of the expensive quadratic program. The new technique is expected to enlarge the scope of applicability of MPC to small-size/fast-sampling applications which cannot be covered satisfactorily with anti-windup schemes},

abstract = {A legged robot walking on uneven terrain can avoid falling only by applying contact forces with its feet on the ground that compensate for gravity without causing slip. To plan safe motions, it is necessary to test this constraint at every posture explored at each set of foot placements. Since a huge number of postures may be explored, this test must be as fast as possible. Existing approaches either search explicitly for contact forces at each posture, or precompute the support polygon and check that the robot's center of mass lies above it. This paper presents a new algorithm that is faster than either existing approach. This algorithm is an incremental method of projection, that computes only enough of the support polygon to decide whether static equilibrium is possible at each posture. It takes advantage of information gained testing previous postures in order to test subsequent postures more quickly},

In pursuit of sample-efficient methods for uncertain black-box verification then, we first detail a method to estimate the Value-at-Risk of arbitrary scalar random variables without requiring \textit{apriori} knowledge of its distribution. Then, we reformulate the uncertain verification problem as a Value-at-Risk estimation problem making use of our prior results. In doing so, we provide fundamental sampling requirements to bound with high confidence the volume of states and parameters for a black-box system that could potentially yield unsafe phenomena. We also show that this procedure works independent of system complexity through simulated examples of the Robotarium.},

abstract = {—Both global methods and on-line trajectory opti-mization methods are powerful techniques for solving optimal control problems; however, each has limitations. In order to mitigate the undesirable properties of each, we explore the possibility of combining the two. We explore two methods of deriving a descriptive final cost function to assist model predictive control (MPC) in selecting a good policy without having to plan as far into the future or having to fine-tune delicate cost functions. First, we exploit the large amount of data which is generated in MPC simulations (based on the receding horizon iterative LQG method) to learn, off-line, the global optimal value function for use as a final cost. We demonstrate that, while the global function approximation matches the value function well on some problems, there is relatively little improvement to the original MPC. Alternatively, we solve the Bellman equation directly using aggregation methods for linearly-solvable Markov Decision Processes to obtain an approximation to the value function and the optimal policy. Using both pieces of information in the MPC framework, we find controller performance of similar quality to MPC alone with long horizon, but now we may drastically shorten the horizon. Implementation of these methods shows that Bellman equation-based methods and on-line trajectory methods can be combined in real applications to the benefit of both.},

@article{Schildbach2014,
abstract = {Many practical applications in control require that constraints on the inputs and states of the system are respected, while some performance criterion is optimized. In the presence of model uncertainties or disturbances, it is often sufficient to satisfy the state constraints for at least a prescribed share of the time, such as in building climate control or load mitigation for wind turbines. For such systems, this paper presents a new method of Scenario-Based Model Predictive Control (SCMPC). The basic idea is to optimize the control inputs over a finite horizon, subject to robust constraint satisfaction under a finite number of random scenarios of the uncertainty and/or disturbances. Previous SCMPC approaches have suffered from a substantial gap between the rate of constraint violations specified in the optimal control problem and that actually observed in closed-loop operation of the controlled system. This paper identifies the two theoretical explanations for this gap. First, accounting for the special structure of the optimal control problem leads to a substantial reduction of the problem dimension. Second, the probabilistic constraints have to be interpreted as average-in-time, rather than pointwise-in-time. Based on these insights, a novel SCMPC method can be devised for general linear systems with additive and multiplicative disturbances, for which the number of scenarios is significantly reduced. The presented method retains the essential advantages of the general SCMPC approach, namely a low computational complexity and the ability to handle arbitrary probability distributions. Moreover, the computational complexity can be adjusted by a sample-and-remove strategy.},

@article{Paul2006,
abstract = {The fact that the morphology of a robot affects its control requirements has become increasingly evident in robotics. Not only does the morphology determine the behaviors that can be performed, but also the amount of control required for these behaviors. Particularly in systems where behavior is obtained through purely sensory-motor interactions of the body with the environment, the morphology is of prime importance. Nonetheless, even in other robotic systems, a relationship has been found to exist between morphology and control requirements, in that some morphologies yield themselves to being more easily controlled than others. This relationship was first observed and characterized by Pfeifer as the morphology and control trade-off [R. Pfeifer, C. Scheier, Understanding Intelligence, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1999], but the mechanisms underlying this relationship have been unclear. However, the discovery of morphological computation,11def: computation obtained through interactions of physical form. [C. Paul, Investigation of Morphology and Control in Biped Locomotion, Ph.D. Thesis, Department of Computer Science, University of Zurich, Switzerland, 2004], the phenomenon that computation can be obtained through interactions of physical form, elucidates a possible mechanism underlying this relationship. The fact that simple physical interactions give rise to computation indicates the theoretical possibility for the dynamics of the morphology to play a computational role in the system, and thereby to subsume part of the role of control. Thus, it may serve to analyse the relationship between morphology and control, and guide the design of robots with reduced control requirements. The goal of the paper is to explore this possibility. The paper introduces the concept of morphological computation in the context of robot morphology, discusses its potential role in the morphology and control trade-off, and then uses it as a basis to develop a heuristic for the design of robots with reduced control requirements. The heuristic is then tested through experiments to validate its accuracy. The preliminary results are promising, and suggest that morphological computation can be a suitable framework for the analysis of morphology and control requirements. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Reproducing the diverse and agile locomotion skills of animals has been a longstanding challenge in robotics. While manually-designed controllers have been able to emulate many complex behaviors, building such controllers involves a time-consuming and difficult development process, often requiring substantial expertise of the nuances of each skill. Reinforcement learning provides an appealing alternative for automating the manual effort involved in the development of controllers. However, designing learning objectives that elicit the desired behaviors from an agent can also require a great deal of skill-specific expertise. In this work, we present an imitation learning system that enables legged robots to learn agile locomotion skills by imitating real-world animals. We show that by leveraging reference motion data, a single learning-based approach is able to automatically synthesize controllers for a diverse repertoire behaviors for legged robots. By incorporating sample efficient domain adaptation techniques into the training process, our system is able to learn adaptive policies in simulation that can then be quickly adapted for real-world deployment. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, we train an 18-DoF quadruped robot to perform a variety of agile behaviors ranging from different locomotion gaits to dynamic hops and turns.},

It is able to generate stable and realistic behaviors for a range of dynamical systems and tasks – swimming, flying, biped and quadruped walking with different body morphologies. It does not require motion capture or task-specific features or state machines. The controller is a neural network, having a large number of feed-forward units that learn elaborate state-action mappings, and a small number of recurrent units that implement memory states beyond the physical system state. The action generated by the network is defined as velocity. Thus the network is not learning a control policy, but rather the dynamics under an implicit policy. Essential features of the method include interleaving supervised learning with trajectory optimization, injecting noise during training, training for unexpected changes in the task specification, and using the trajectory optimizer to obtain optimal feedback gains in addition to optimal actions.

We augment the NeRF rendering of the static scene by overlaying the rendering of other dynamic objects (e.g. the robot's own body, a ball). A simulation is then created using the rendering engine in a physics simulator which computes contact dynamics from the static scene geometry (estimated from the NeRF volume density) and the dynamic objects' geometry and physical properties (assumed known). We demonstrate that we can use this simulation to learn vision-based whole body navigation and ball pushing policies for a 20 degrees of freedom humanoid robot with an actuated head-mounted RGB camera, and we successfully transfer these policies to a real robot.

abstract = {From which states and with what controls can a biped avoid falling or reach a given target state? What is the most robust way to do these? So as to help with the design of walking robot controllers, and perhaps give insights into human walking, we address these questions using two simple 2-D models: the inverted pendulum (IP) and linear inverted pendulum (LIP). Each has one state variable at mid-stance, i.e., hip velocity, and two state-dependent controls at each step, i.e., push-off magnitude and step length (IP) and step time and length (LIP). Using practical targets and constraints, we compute all combinations of initial states and control actions for the next step, such that the robot can, with the best possible future controls, avoid falling for n steps or reach a target within n steps. All such combinations constitute regions in the combined space of states and controls. Farther from the boundaries of these regions, the robot tolerates larger errors and disturbances. Furthermore, for these models, and thus possibly real bipeds, usually if it is possible to avoid falling, it is possible to reach the target, and if it is possible to reach the target, it is possible to do so in two steps.},

The robot was controlled by a closed loop recurrent neu- ral network controller. The goal was to study the effect of macroscopic, midrange and microscopic changes in mass distribution along the biped skeleton to ascertain whether optimal morphology and control pairs could be discovered. The sensor-motor coupling determined that small changes in morphology manifest themselves as large changes in the performance of the biped, which were exploited by the op- timization process. In this way, mechanical design and controller optimization were reduced to a single process, and more mutually optimized designs resulted. This work points to alternative routes for efficient automated and man- ual biped optimization.},

It is difficult to select the best tool for a given project, or to predict how much effort will be needed and what the ultimate simulation performance will be. Here we introduce new quantitative measures of simulation performance, focusing on the numerical challenges that are typical for robotics as opposed to multi-body dynamics and gaming. We then present extensive simulation results, obtained within a new software framework for instantiating the same model in multiple engines and running side-by-side comparisons. Overall we find that each engine performs best on the type of system it was designed and optimized for: MuJoCo wins the robotics-related tests, while the gaming engines win the gaming-related tests without a clear leader among them. The simulations are illustrated in the accompanying movie.},

Through a number of case studies we will show that within this interaction dynamics there is sparse global structure, i.e. a structure that can be characterized by only a small number of points in phase space, and that it is best to interact with the agent, i.e. interfere with its dynamics, at these points. We introduce a humanoid robot with the capability for dynamic full-body movement. The preliminary results of two experiments, sitting and standing up, are presented.

abstract = {Experience with Euler's 1 method raises some interesting questions about numerical approxima-tions for the solutions of differential equations. 1. What determines the amount of numerical error in an approximation? 2. Why is that halving the step size tends to decrease the numerical error in Euler's method by one-half and the numerical error in the modified Euler method by one-quarter? 3. Are some differential equations more difficult to approximate numerically than others? If so, can this be predicted without doing numerical experiments? None of these questions has a simple answer, but we will at least be able to offer a partial answer for each. MODEL PROBLEM 1 The initial value problem dy dt = 2y − 18t 1 + t , y(0) = 4 has solution y = 4 + 8t − 5t 2 . Determine how many subdivisions are needed to assure that the Euler's method approximation on the interval [0, 2] has error no greater than 0.001. INSTANT EXERCISE 1 Verify the solution formula for Model Problem 1. The Meaning of Error Any approximation of a function necessarily allows a possibility of deviation from the correct value of the function. Error is the term used to denote the amount by which an approximation fails to equal the exact solution (exact solution minus approximation). 2 Error occurs in an approximation for several reasons. 1 pronounced " Oy-ler " 2 In everyday vocabulary, we tend to use the term error to denote an avoidable human failing, as for example when a baseball player mishandles the ball. In numerical analysis, error is a characteristic of an approximation correctly performed. Unacceptable error dictates a need for greater refinement or a better method. 1 Truncation error in a numerical method is error that is caused by using simple approxima-tions to represent exact mathematical formulas. The only way to completely avoid truncation error is to use exact calculations. However, truncation error can be reduced by applying the same approximation to a larger number of smaller intervals or by switching to a better approx-imation. Analysis of truncation error is the single most important source of information about the theoretical characteristics that distinguish better methods from poorer ones. With a com-bination of theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, it is possible to estimate truncation error accurately. Round-off error in a numerical method is error that is caused by using a discrete number of significant digits to represent real numbers on a computer. Since computers can retain a large number of digits in a computation, round-off error is problematic only when the approximation requires that the computer subtract two numbers that are nearly identical. This is exactly what happens if we apply an approximation to intervals that are too small. Thus, the effort to decrease truncation error can have the unintended consequence of introducing significant round-off error. Practitioners of numerical approximation are most concerned with truncation error, but they also try to restrict their efforts at decreasing truncation error to improvements that do not introduce significant round-off error. In our study of approximation error, we consider only truncation error. We seek information about error on both a local and global scale. Local truncation error is the amount of truncation error that occurs in one step of a numerical approximation. Global truncation error is the amount of truncation error that occurs in the use of a numerical approximation to solve a problem. Taylor's Theorem and Approximations},

abstract = {To plan dynamic, whole-body motions for robots, one conventionally faces the choice between a complex, full- body dynamic model containing every link and actuator of the robot, or a highly simplified model of the robot as a point mass. In this paper we explore a powerful middle ground between these extremes. We exploit the fact that while the full dynamics of humanoid robots are complicated, their centroidal dynamics (the evolution of the angular momentum and the center of mass (COM) position) are much simpler. By treating the dynamics of the robot in centroidal form and directly optimizing the joint trajectories for the actuated degrees of freedom, we arrive at a method that enjoys simpler dynamics, while still having the expressiveness required to handle kinematic constraints such as collision avoidance or reaching to a target. We further require that the robot's COM and angular momentum as computed from the joint trajectories match those given by the centroidal dynamics. This ensures that the dynamics considered by our optimization are equivalent to the full dynamics of the robot, provided that the robot's actuators can supply sufficient torque. We demonstrate that this algorithm is capable of generating highly-dynamic motion plans with examples of a humanoid robot negotiating obstacle course elements and gait optimization for a quadrupedal robot. Additionally, we show that we can plan without pre-specifying the contact sequence by exploiting the complementarity conditions between contact forces and contact distance.},

A control scheme reverting to a backup solution from a previous time step in case of infeasibility is proposed, for which an asymptotic average performance bound is derived. Two examples illustrate the approach, highlighting closed-loop chance constraint satisfaction and the benefits of the proposed controller in the presence of unmodeled disturbances.},

abstract = {— Most animal and human locomotion behaviors for solving complex tasks involve dynamic motions and rich contact interaction. In fact, complex maneuvers need to con-sider dynamic movement and contact events at the same time. We present a hierarchical trajectory optimization approach for planning dynamic movements with unscheduled contact sequences. We compute whole-body motions that achieve goals that cannot be reached in a kinematic fashion. First, we find a feasible CoM motion according to the centroidal dynamics of the robot. Then, we refine the solution by applying the robot's full-dynamics model, where the feasible CoM trajectory is used as warm-start point. To accomplish the unscheduled contact behavior, we use complementarity constraints to describe the contact model, i.e. environment geometry and non-sliding active contacts. Both optimization phases are posed as Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC). Exper-imental trials demonstrate the performance of our planning approach in a set of challenging tasks.},

The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

@article{Bretl2006a,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of planning the motion of a multi-limbed robot in order to “free-climb ” vertical rock surfaces. Free-climbing only relies on frictional contact with the surfaces rather than on special fixtures or tools like pitons. It requires strength, but more importantly it requires deliberate reasoning: not only must the robot decide how to adjust its posture to reach the next feature without falling, it must plan an entire sequence of steps, where each one might have future consequences. In this paper, this process of reasoning is broken into manageable pieces by decomposing a free-climbing robot's configuration space into manifolds associated with each state of contact between the robot and its environment. A multi-step planning framework is presented that decides which manifolds to explore by generating a candidate sequence of hand and foot placements first. A one-step planning algorithm is then described that explores individual manifolds quickly. This algorithm extends the probabilistic roadmap approach to better handle the interaction between static equilibrium and the topology of closed kinematic chains. It is assumed throughout this paper that a set of potential contact points has been presurveyed. Validation with real hardware was done with a four-limbed robot called lemur (developed by the Mechanical and Robotic Technologies Group at nasa-jpl). Using the planner presented in this paper, lemur free-climbed an indoor, near-vertical surface covered with artificial rock features. 1},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning is a promising approach to synthesizing policies for robotics tasks. A key challenge is ensuring safety of the learned policy---e.g., that a walking robot does not fall over, or an autonomous car does not run into an obstacle. We focus on the setting where the dynamics are known, and the goal is to prove that a policy trained in simulation satisfies a given safety constraint. We build on an approach called shielding, which uses a backup policy to override the learned policy as needed to ensure safety. Our algorithm, called model predictive shielding (MPS), computes whether it is safe to use the learned policy on-the-fly instead of ahead-of-time. By doing so, our approach is computationally efficient, and can furthermore be used to ensure safety even in novel environments. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the benefits of our approach.},

The VSCM facilitates the convergence of gradient-based optimization without compromising physical fidelity. On the other hand, SCvx combines the advantages of direct and shooting methods for CITO. For evaluations, non-prehensile manipulation tasks are considered. We compare the proposed method to a version based on iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) on a planar example. The proposed SCvx-based method is also tested on a standard robot platform. The results demonstrate that both methods can find physically-consistent motions that achieve the tasks without a meaningful initial guess owing to the VSCM. The proposed SCvx-based method outperforms the iLQR-based method in terms of convergence, computation time, and the quality of motions found. Finally, the proposed approach is shown to perform efficiently for real-world applications.},

abstract = {We study the problem of training deep fully connected neural networks with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function and cross entropy loss function for binary classification using gradient descent. We show that with proper random weight initialization, gradient descent can find the global minima of the training loss for an over-parameterized deep ReLU network, under certain assumption on the training data. The key idea of our proof is that Gaussian random initialization followed by gradient descent produces a sequence of iterates that stay inside a small perturbation region centered at the initial weights, in which the training loss function of the deep ReLU networks enjoys nice local curvature properties that ensure the global convergence of gradient descent. At the core of our proof technique is (1) a milder assumption on the training data; (2) a sharp analysis of the trajectory length for gradient descent; and (3) a finer characterization of the size of the perturbation region. Compared with the concurrent work (Allen-Zhu et al. in A convergence theory for deep learning via over-parameterization, 2018a; Du et al. in Gradient descent finds global minima of deep neural networks, 2018a) along this line, our result relies on milder over-parameterization condition on the neural network width, and enjoys faster global convergence rate of gradient descent for training deep neural networks.},

abstract = {Abstract—We present a novel MPC method for humanoid gait generation that is guaranteed to produce stable CoM trajectories. This is obtained by using a dynamic extension of the LIP as motion model, with the ZMP velocity as a control variable, and embedding an explicit stability constraint in the formulation. Such constraint turns out to be linear in the control variables, leading to a standard QP problem with equality and inequality constraints. The intrinsically stable MPC framework is developed into a full-fledged gait generation scheme by including automatic footstep placement. Simulations show that the proposed method is very effective and performs robustly in the presence of changes in the prediction horizon.},

@article{Zeilinger2014,
abstract = {High-speed applications impose a hard real-time constraint on the solution of a model predictive control (MPC) problem, which generally prevents the computation of the optimal control input. As a result, in most MPC implementations guarantees on feasibility and stability are sacrificed in order to achieve a real-time setting. In this paper we develop a real-time MPC approach for linear systems that provides these guarantees for arbitrary time constraints, allowing one to trade off computation time vs. performance. Stability is guaranteed by means of a constraint, enforcing that the resulting suboptimal MPC cost is a Lyapunov function. The key is then to guarantee feasibility in real-time, which is achieved by the proposed algorithm through a warm-starting technique in combination with robust MPC design. We address both regulation and tracking of piecewise constant references. As a main contribution of this paper, a new warm-start procedure together with a Lyapunov function for real-time tracking is presented. In addition to providing strong theoretical guarantees, the proposed method can be implemented at high sampling rates. Simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the real-time scheme and show that computation times in the millisecond range can be achieved. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this tutorial is to highlight a novel chapter of control theory, dealing with dynamic models of social networks and processes over them, to the attention of the broad research community.

This paper is the second part of the tutorial, and it is focused on more recent models of social processes that have been developed concurrently with MAS theory.

abstract = {Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully applied to a range of challenging sequential decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: high sample complexity and brittleness to hyperparameters. Both of these challenges limit the applicability of such methods to real-world domains. In this paper, we describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks, as well as real-world challenging tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements, SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving similar performance across different random seeds. These results suggest that SAC is a promising candidate for learning in real-world robotics tasks.},

In this paper, we study the role of model usage in policy optimization both theoretically and empirically. We first formulate and analyze a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm with a guarantee of monotonic improvement at each step. In practice, this analysis is overly pessimistic and suggests that real off-policy data is always preferable to model-generated on-policy data, but we show that an empirical estimate of model generalization can be incorporated into such analysis to justify model usage. Motivated by this analysis, we then demonstrate that a simple procedure of using short model-generated rollouts branched from real data has the benefits of more complicated model-based algorithms without the usual pitfalls. In particular, this approach surpasses the sample efficiency of prior model-based methods, matches the asymptotic performance of the best model-free algorithms, and scales to horizons that cause other model-based methods to fail entirely.},

abstract = {Conventional humanoids have achieved walking and running by independent controllers, even though a transition between these independent motions should be added to connect them while ensuring stability. In contrast, human selects walking/running at low/high speed in terms of energy efficiency, and transits between them naturally. This fact implies that human gait shares the inherent controller among walking and running despite their quite different appearances. Hence, we propose a “unified bipedal gait,” which includes walking, running, and the transition. The unified bipedal gait has the inherent controller: passive dynamic autonomous control (PDAC) with a damping and spring loaded inverted pendulum (D-SLIP) model. The PDAC constrains the humanoid natural dynamics by a virtual holonomic constraint (VHC) that degenerates the natural manifold of the states for stabilization. Compliance in the D-SLIP is capable to yield the required characteristics of walking/running: low/high compliant legs for walking/running. Thus, a novel VHC is designed to extract the required characteristics of walking/running from the D-SLIP dynamics and form the proper manifold. As a result, we achieved the unified bipedal gait that bifurcates to walking and running via the natural transition. The high energy efficiency was confirmed in this unified bipedal gait at any gait speed.},

abstract = {Dynamical systems with stochastic uncertainties are ubiquitous in the field of control, with linear systems under additive Gaussian disturbances a most prominent example. The concept of probabilistic invariance was introduced to extend the widely applied concept of invariance to this class of problems. Computational methods for their synthesis, however, are limited. In this paper we present a relationship between probabilistic and robust invariant sets for linear systems, which enables the use of well-studied robust design methods. Conditions are shown, under which a robust invariant set, designed with a confidence region of the disturbance, results in a probabilistic invariant set. We furthermore show that this condition holds for common box and ellipsoidal confidence regions, generalizing and improving existing results for probabilistic invariant set computation. We finally exemplify the synthesis for an ellipsoidal probabilistic invariant set. Two numerical examples demonstrate the approach and the advantages to be gained from exploiting robust computations for probabilistic invariant sets.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) and trajectory optimization (TO) present strong complementary advantages. On one hand, RL approaches are able to learn global control policies directly from data, but generally require large sample sizes to properly converge towards feasible policies. On the other hand, TO methods are able to exploit gradient-based information extracted from simulators to quickly converge towards a locally optimal control trajectory which is only valid within the vicinity of the solution. Over the past decade, several approaches have aimed to adequately combine the two classes of methods in order to obtain the best of both worlds. Following on from this line of research, we propose several improvements on top of these approaches to learn global control policies quicker, notably by leveraging sensitivity information stemming from TO methods via Sobolev learning, and augmented Lagrangian techniques to enforce the consensus between TO and policy learning. We evaluate the benefits of these improvements on various classical tasks in robotics through comparison with existing approaches in the literature.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new method of computing a sub-optimal solution of a continuous-time continuous-space chance-constrained stochastic nonlinear optimal control problem (SNOC) problem. The proposed method involves two steps. The first step is to derive a deterministic nonlinear optimal control problem (DNOC) with convex constraints that are surrogate to the SNOC by using generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansion and tools taken from chance-constrained programming. The second step is to solve the DNOC problem using sequential convex programming (SCP) for trajectory generation. We prove that in the unconstrained case, the optimal value of the DNOC converges to that of SNOC asymptotically and that any feasible solution of the constrained DNOC is a feasible solution of the chance-constrained SNOC because the gPC approximation of the random variables converges to the true distribution. The effectiveness of the gPC-SCP method is demonstrated by computing safe trajectories for a second-order planar robot model with multiplicative stochastic uncertainty entering at the input while avoiding collisions with a specified probability.},

abstract = {Neural networks predictions are unreliable when the input sample is out of the training distribution or corrupted by noise. Being able to detect such failures automatically is fundamental to integrate deep learning algorithms into robotics. Current approaches for uncertainty estimation of neural networks require changes to the network and optimization process, typically ignore prior knowledge about the data, and tend to make over-simplifying assumptions which underestimate uncertainty. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for uncertainty estimation. Based on Bayesian belief networks and Monte-Carlo sampling, our framework not only fully models the different sources of prediction uncertainty, but also incorporates prior data information, e.g. sensor noise. We show theoretically that this gives us the ability to capture uncertainty better than existing methods. In addition, our framework has several desirable properties: (i) it is agnostic to the network architecture and task; (ii) it does not require changes in the optimization process; (iii) it can be applied to already trained architectures. We thoroughly validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on both computer vision and control tasks, where we outperform previous methods by up to 23% in accuracy. The video available at https://youtu.be/X7n-bRS5vSM shows qualitative results of our experiments. The project's code is available at: https://tinyurl.com/s3nygw7.},

Direct methods often employ scale-space smoothing (Gaussian blur) of the images to avoid local minima.

In this work, we derive blur kernels that result from smoothing the alignment objective function for some common motion models such as affine and homography. We show the derived kernels remove poor local minima and reach lower energy solutions in practice. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

The controller provably guarantees global asymptotic convergence of

This rapid prototyping process enables users to create lightweight, affordable, and materially versatile robots with short turnaround time. Using Interactive Robogami, designers can compose new robot designs from a database of print-and-fold parts. The designs are tested for the users' functional specifications via simulation and fabricated on user satisfaction. We present six robots designed and fabricated using a 3D printing based approach, as well as a larger robot cut from sheet metal. We have also conducted a user study that demonstrates that our tool is intuitive for novice designers and expressive enough to create a wide variety of ground robot designs.},

This sensor consists of a transparent skin made with a marked soft elastic outer layer on a hard layer, and internal RGB cameras. The cameras can see the external scene through the skin. This sensor provides a contact force field estimated by tracking markers in the skin, and visual information of close or grasped objects. This sensor uses off-the-shelf materials, is easy to manufacture, and is robust against an external force as the force is not applied to the sensing devices (cameras). We install a prototype of this sensor on fingers of a Baxter robot, and demonstrate its usefulness with a cutting vegetable task. The sensor gave us force information to control cutting vegetables and avoiding slippage of the knife. Accompanying video: https://youtu.be/ifOwQdy9gDg},

abstract = {Contact constraints, such as those between a foot and the ground or a hand and an object, are inherent in many robotic tasks. These constraints define a manifold of feasible states; while well understood mathematically, they pose numerical challenges to many algorithms for planning and controlling whole-body dynamic motions. In this paper, we present an approach to the synthesis and stabilization of complex trajectories for both fully-actuated and underactuated robots subject to contact constraints. We introduce an extension to the direct collocation trajectory optimization algorithm that naturally incorporates the manifold constraints to produce a nominal trajectory with third-order integration accuracy---a critical feature for achieving reliable tracking control. We adapt the classical time-varying linear quadratic regulator to produce a local cost-to-go in the tangent plane of the manifold. Finally, we descend the cost-to-go using a quadratic program that incorporates unilateral friction and torque constraints. This approach is demonstrated on three complex walking and climbing locomotion examples in simulation.},

Direct methods often employ scale-space smoothing (Gaussian blur) of the images to avoid local minima. Although, it is known that the isotropic blur used is not optimal for some motion models, the correct blur kernels have not been rigorously derived for motion models beyond translations. In this work, we derive blur kernels that result from smoothing the alignment objective function for some common motion models such as affine and homography. We show the derived kernels remove poor local minima and reach lower energy solutions in practice. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Instinctively, for tasks involving multiple time- varying contacts interactions (e.g., walking, climbing stairs, etc.) humans plan their predictable contact configurations such that balance stability during the given task is not compromised (Padois et al., 2016). On the other hand, designing balance controllers that allow biped robots to exploit the available contact interactions, while predicting their effects on the system's balance stability, is still a challenge. In this work, a novel computational approach (Mummolo et al., 2017) is extended to investigate the effects of various contact configurations on the balancing capabilities of constrained biped systems. A balance stability region is identified in the center of mass (COM) state space that includes all states (position and velocity) from which the biped system can be balanced while satisfying physical constraints and maintaining the specified contact configuration. The stability region boundary is constructed via an optimization-based algorithm and provides a contact- dependent threshold between balanced and falling states for the given system. A COM state outside of the stability region boundary represents the sufficient condition for a falling state, from which a change in the specified contact configuration is inevitable. Experimental trajectories of robotic and human walking are analyzed relative to their corresponding contact-dependent stability regions, to gain insights on the different balance stability strategies between robot and human in various phases of the walking motion.},

In this paper, we address the problem of construction of the NCR for control-affine nonlinear systems with input constraints. To this end, we explain how the boundary of the NCR is covered by time-optimal trajectories. To construct the NCR, we employ an algorithm based on Pontryagin's minimum principle, which integrates optimal trajectories of a special smooth system in reverse time from the boundary of an initial NCR estimate. We illustrate this algorithm with linear and nonlinear system examples.},

The goal of this paper is to revisit this classic formulation in the context of safety-critical control. This will motivate a variant of aCLFs in the context of safety: adaptive Control Barrier Functions (aCBFs). Our proposed approach adaptively achieves safety by keeping the system's state within a safe set even in the presence of parametric model uncertainty. We unify aCLFs and aCBFs into a single control methodology for systems with uncertain parameters in the context of a Quadratic Program (QP) based framework. We validate the ability of this unified framework to achieve stability and safety in an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) simulation.},

abstract = {Value function learning plays a central role in many state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning algorithms. Many popular algorithms like Q-learning do not optimize any objective function, but are fixed-point iterations of some variants of Bellman operator that are not necessarily a contraction. As a result, they may easily lose convergence guarantees, as can be observed in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel loss function, which can be optimized using standard gradient-based methods with guaranteed convergence. The key advantage is that its gradient can be easily approximated using sampled transitions, avoiding the need for double samples required by prior algorithms like residual gradient. Our approach may be combined with general function classes such as neural networks, using either on- or off-policy data, and is shown to work reliably and effectively in several benchmarks, including classic problems where standard algorithms are known to diverge.},

First, using a very elementary control problem, we illustrate that the learning process can get stuck into a fixed point corresponding to a poor solution. Then, generalizing from the studied example, we provide a detailed analysis of the underlying mechanisms which results in a new understanding of one of the convergence regimes of these algorithms. The resulting perspective casts a new light on already existing solutions to the issues we have highlighted, and suggests other potential approaches.},

abstract = {One step on the way to approach human performance in robotics is to provide joint torque sensing and control for better interaction capabilities with the environment, and a large number of actuated degrees of freedom (DOFs) for improved versatility. However, the increasing complexity also raises the question of how to resolve the kinematic redundancy which is a direct consequence of the large number of DOFs. Here we give an overview of the most practical and frequently used torque control solutions based on null space projections. Two fundamental structures of task hierarchies are reviewed and compared, namely the successive and the augmented method. Then the projector itself is investigated in terms of its con- sistency. We analyze static, dynamic, and the new concept of stiffness consistency. In the latter case, stiffness information is used in the pseudoinversion instead of the inertia matrix. In terms of dynamic consistency, we generalize the weighting matrix from the classical operational space approach and show that an infinite number of weighting matrices exist to obtain dynamic consistency. In this context we also analyze another dynamically consistent null space projector with slightly different structure and properties. The redundancy resolutions are finally compared in several simulations and experiments. A thorough discussion of the theoretical and empirical results completes this survey.},

abstract = {The recently introduced Intelligent Trial-and-Error (IT&E) algorithm showed that robots can adapt to damage in a matter of a few trials. The success of this algorithm relies on two components: prior knowledge acquired through simulation with an intact robot, and Bayesian optimization (BO) that operates on-line, on the damaged robot. While IT&E leads to fast damage recovery, it does not incorporate any safety constraints that prevent the robot from attempting harmful behaviors. In this work, we address this limitation by replacing the BO component with a constrained BO procedure. We evaluate our approach on a simulated damaged humanoid robot that needs to crawl as fast as possible, while performing as few unsafe trials as possible. We compare our new "safety-aware IT&E" algorithm to IT&E and a multi-objective version of IT&E in which the safety constraints are dealt as separate objectives. Our results show that our algorithm outperforms the other approaches, both in crawling speed within the safe regions and number of unsafe trials.},

However, there exists no rigorous mathematical explanation why this works so well. The training of neural networks with stochastic gradient descent has four different discretization parameters: (i) the network architecture; (ii) the amount of training data; (iii) the number of gradient steps; and (iv) the number of randomly initialized gradient trajectories. While it can be shown that the approximation error converges to zero if all four parameters are sent to infinity in the right order, we demonstrate in this paper that stochastic gradient descent fails to converge for ReLU networks if their depth is much larger than their width and the number of random initializations does not increase to infinity fast enough.},

abstract = {Being able to fall safely is a necessary motor skill for humanoids performing highly dynamic tasks, such as running and jumping. We propose a new method to learn a policy that minimizes the maximal impulse during the fall. The optimization solves for both a discrete contact planning problem and a continuous optimal control problem. Once trained, the policy can compute the optimal next contacting body part (e.g. left foot, right foot, or hands), contact location and timing, and the required joint actuation. We represent the policy as a mixture of actor-critic neural network, which consists of n control policies and the corresponding value functions. Each pair of actor-critic is associated with one of the n possible contacting body parts. During execution, the policy corresponding to the highest value function will be executed while the associated body part will be the next contact with the ground. With this mixture of actor-critic architecture, the discrete contact sequence planning is solved through the selection of the best critics while the continuous control problem is solved by the optimization of actors. We show that our policy can achieve comparable, sometimes even higher, rewards than a recursive search of the action space using dynamic programming, while enjoying 50 to 400 times of speed gain during online execution.},

abstract = {The Sequential Linear Quadratic (SLQ) algorithm is a continuous-time variant of the well-known Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) technique with a Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation. This family of methods has gained popularity in the robotics community due to its efficiency in solving complex trajectory optimization problems. However, one major drawback of DDP-based formulations is their inability to properly incorporate path constraints. In this paper, we address this issue by devising a constrained SLQ algorithm that handles a mixture of constraints with a previously implemented projection technique and a new augmented-Lagrangian approach. By providing an appropriate multiplier update law, and by solving a single inner and outer loop iteration, we are able to retrieve suboptimal solutions at rates suitable for real-time model-predictive control applications. We particularly focus on the inequality-constrained case, where three augmented-Lagrangian penalty functions are introduced, along with their corresponding multiplier update rules. These are then benchmarked against a relaxed log-barrier formulation in a cart-pole swing up example, an obstacle-avoidance task, and an object-pushing task with a quadrupedal mobile manipulator.},

This is of limited use for dynamical systems that run indefinitely. We introduce the first method for verifying the time-unbounded safety of neural networks controlling dynamical systems. We develop a novel abstract interpretation method which, by constructing adaptable template-based polyhedra using MILP and interval arithmetic, yields sound-safe and invariant-overapproximations of the reach set. This provides stronger safety guarantees than previous time-bounded methods and shows whether the agent has generalised beyond the length of its training episodes. Our method supports ReLU activation functions and systems with linear, piecewise linear and non-linear dynamics defined with polynomial and transcendental functions. We demonstrate its efficacy on a range of benchmark control problems.},

While there are many works analyzing the transitions involved in walking, very few works analyze human motion where more complex supports occur. In this work, we analyze complex support pose transitions in human motion involving locomotion and manipulation tasks (loco-manipulation). We have applied a method for the detection of human support contacts from motion capture data to a large-scale dataset of loco-manipulation motions involving multi-contact supports, providing a semantic representation of them. Our results provide a statistical analysis of the used support poses, their transitions and the time spent in each of them. In addition, our data partially validates our taxonomy of whole-body support poses presented in our previous work. We believe that this work extends our understanding of human motion for humanoids, with a long-term objective of developing methods for autonomous multi-contact motion planning.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The recently described posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) classically consists of reversible vasogenic edema in the posterior circulation territories, although conversion to irreversible cytotoxic edema has been described. We hypothesized that the extent of edema has prognostic implications and that diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) can help predict the progression to infarction. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with PRES and 18 control subjects were examined with isotropic DWI. Nineteen regions of interest (ROIs) were systematically placed, and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were computed and correlated with T2 and DWI signal intensity in each ROI. RESULTS: T2 signal abnormalities were always present in territories of the posterior circulation. Anterior circulation structures were involved in 91% of patients. ADC values in areas of abnormal T2 signal were high. More extensive T2 signal abnormalities were seen in patients with a poor outcome than in patients who recovered. In six patients (27%), areas of high DWI signal intensity were seen with ADC values that were paradoxically normal, which we called pseudonormalized. Abnormal T2 signal intensity and high ADC values surrounded these areas. Follow-up images in two patients showed progression to infarction in pseudonormalized regions. CONCLUSION: Vasogenic edema in PRES involves predominantly the posterior circulation territories, but anterior circulation structures are also frequently involved. The extent of combined T2 and DWI signal abnormalities correlate with patient outcome. High DWI signal intensity and pseudonormalized ADC values are associated with cerebral infarction and may represent the earliest sign of nonreversibility as severe vasogenic edema progresses to cytotoxic edema.},

abstract = {Many of the successes of machine learning are based on minimizing an averaged loss function. However, it is well-known that this paradigm suffers from robustness issues that hinder its applicability in safety-critical domains. These issues are often addressed by training against worst-case perturbations of data, a technique known as adversarial training. Although empirically effective, adversarial training can be overly conservative, leading to unfavorable trade-offs between nominal performance and robustness. To this end, in this paper we propose a framework called probabilistic robustness that bridges the gap between the accurate, yet brittle average case and the robust, yet conservative worst case by enforcing robustness to most rather than to all perturbations. From a theoretical point of view, this framework overcomes the trade-offs between the performance and the sample-complexity of worst-case and average-case learning. From a practical point of view, we propose a novel algorithm based on risk-aware optimization that effectively balances average- and worst-case performance at a considerably lower computational cost relative to adversarial training. Our results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN illustrate the advantages of this framework on the spectrum from average- to worst-case robustness.},

abstract = {When a robot is highly redundant in comparison to the task to be executed, current control techniques are not "economic" in the sense that they demand, most of the time unnecessarily, all the joints to move. Such behavior can be undesirable for some applications. In this direction, this work proposes a new control paradigm based on linear programming that intrinsically provides a parsimonious control strategy, i.e, one in which few joints move. In addition to a formal stability proof, this letter presents simulation and experimental results on the HOAP-3 humanoid robot. Finally, a comparison is made with a least-square method based on the pseudoinverse of the task Jacobian, showing that the proposed method indeed uses fewer joints than the classic one.},

abstract = {It is common practice to decay the learning rate. Here we show one can usually obtain the same learning curve on both training and test sets by instead increasing the batch size during training. This procedure is successful for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), SGD with momentum, Nesterov momentum, and Adam. It reaches equivalent test accuracies after the same number of training epochs, but with fewer parameter updates, leading to greater parallelism and shorter training times. We can further reduce the number of parameter updates by increasing the learning rate $\epsilon$ and scaling the batch size $B \propto \epsilon$. Finally, one can increase the momentum coefficient $m$ and scale $B \propto 1/(1-m)$, although this tends to slightly reduce the test accuracy. Crucially, our techniques allow us to repurpose existing training schedules for large batch training with no hyper-parameter tuning. We train ResNet-50 on ImageNet to $76.1\%$ validation accuracy in under 30 minutes.},

abstract = {Nonlinear trajectory optimization algorithms have been developed to handle optimal control problems with nonlinear dynamics and nonconvex constraints in trajectory planning. The performance and computational efficiency of many trajectory optimization methods are sensitive to the initial guess, i.e., the trajectory guess needed by the recursive trajectory optimization algorithm. Motivated by this observation, we tackle the initialization problem for trajectory optimization via policy optimization. To optimize a policy, we propose a guided policy search method that has two key components: i) Trajectory update; ii) Policy update. The trajectory update involves offline solutions of a large number of trajectory optimization problems from different initial states via Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). Here we take a single SCP step to generate the trajectory iterate for each problem. In conjunction with these iterates, we also generate additional trajectories around each iterate via a feedback control law. Then all these trajectories are used by a stochastic gradient descent algorithm to update the neural network policy, i.e., the policy update step. As a result, the trained policy makes it possible to generate trajectory candidates that are close to the optimality and feasibility and that provide excellent initial guesses for the trajectory optimization methods. We validate the proposed method via a real-world 6-degree-of-freedom powered descent guidance problem for a reusable rocket.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach using sensitivity analysis for generalizing Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) to systems characterized by implicit dynamics, such as those modelled via inverse dynamics and variational or implicit integrators. It leads to a more general formulation of DDP, enabling for example the use of the faster recursive Newton-Euler inverse dynamics. We leverage the implicit formulation for precise and exact contact modelling in DDP, where we focus on two contributions: (1) Contact dynamics in acceleration level that enables high-order integration schemes; (2) Formulation using an invertible contact model in the forward pass and a closed form solution in the backward pass to improve the numerical resolution of contacts. The performance of the proposed framework is validated (1) by comparing implicit versus explicit DDP for the swing-up of a double pendulum, and (2) by planning motions for two tasks using a single leg model making multi-body contacts with the environment: standing up from ground, where a priori contact enumeration is challenging, and maintaining balance under an external perturbation.},

abstract = {Learning-based control aims to construct models of a system to use for planning or trajectory optimization, e.g. in model-based reinforcement learning. In order to obtain guarantees of safety in this context, uncertainty must be accurately quantified. This uncertainty may come from errors in learning (due to a lack of data, for example), or may be inherent to the system. Propagating uncertainty forward in learned dynamics models is a difficult problem. In this work we use deep learning to obtain expressive and flexible models of how distributions of trajectories behave, which we then use for nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC). We introduce a deep quantile regression framework for control that enforces probabilistic quantile bounds and quantifies epistemic uncertainty. Using our method we explore three different approaches for learning tubes that contain the possible trajectories of the system, and demonstrate how to use each of them in a Tube MPC scheme. We prove these schemes are recursively feasible and satisfy constraints with a desired margin of probability. We present experiments in simulation on a nonlinear quadrotor system, demonstrating the practical efficacy of these ideas.},

abstract = {We propose a framework, called neural-progressive hedging (NP), that leverages stochastic programming during the online phase of executing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy. The goal is to ensure feasibility with respect to constraints and risk-based objectives such as conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) during the execution of the policy, using probabilistic models of the state transitions to guide policy adjustments. The framework is particularly amenable to the class of sequential resource allocation problems since feasibility with respect to typical resource constraints cannot be enforced in a scalable manner. The NP framework provides an alternative that adds modest overhead during the online phase. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the NP framework on two continuous real-world tasks: (i) the portfolio optimization problem with liquidity constraints for financial planning, characterized by non-stationary state distributions; and (ii) the dynamic repositioning problem in bike sharing systems, that embodies the class of supply-demand matching problems. We show that the NP framework produces policies that are better than deep RL and other baseline approaches, adapting to non-stationarity, whilst satisfying structural constraints and accommodating risk measures in the resulting policies. Additional benefits of the NP framework are ease of implementation and better explainability of the policies.},

abstract = {An arbitrary rigid transformation in SE(3) can be separated into two parts, namely, a translation and a rigid rotation. This technical report reviews, under a unifying viewpoint, three common alternatives to representing the rotation part: sets of three (yaw-pitch-roll) Euler angles, orthogonal rotation matrices from SO(3) and quaternions. It will be described: (i) the equivalence between these representations and the formulas for transforming one to each other (in all cases considering the translational and rotational parts as a whole), (ii) how to compose poses with poses and poses with points in each representation and (iii) how the uncertainty of the poses (when modeled as Gaussian distributions) is affected by these transformations and compositions. Some brief notes are also given about the Jacobians required to implement least-squares optimization on manifolds, an very promising approach in recent engineering literature. The text reflects which MRPT C++ library 1 functions implement each of the described algorithms. All the implementations have been thoroughly validated by means of unit testing and numerical estimation of the Jacobians.},

The learning problem is formulated as a regression problem to predict a single-step motion given the desired contact locations, which is used as a building block for producing multi-step motions. The predicted motion is then used as a warm-start for the fast optimal control solver Crocoddyl. We have shown that the approach manages to reduce the required number of iterations to reach the convergence from ∼9.5 to only ∼3.0 iterations for the single-step motion and from ∼6.2 to ∼4.5 iterations for the multi-step motion, while maintaining the solution's quality.},

The memory of motion relies on function approximators and dimensionality reduction techniques to learn the mapping between the task and the robot paths. Three function approximators are compared: k-Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian Process Regression, and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Regression. In addition, we show that the usage of the memory of motion can be improved by using an ensemble method, and that the memory can also be used as a metric to choose between several possible goals.

For a Bezier surface patch, there are many possible polyhedral control structures, and none are canonical. We propose a not necessarily polyhedral control structure for surface patches, regular control surfaces, which are certain C^0 spline surfaces. While not unique, regular control surfaces are exactly the possible limiting positions of a Bezier patch when the weights are allowed to vary.},

abstract = {Human beings perform complex tasks while even keeping balance. Though this is evident for a human, it is very difficult to adapt human motion to humanoid robots, due to the posture redundancy. In this paper we propose a conceptually simple framework of human posture control, scoping in a general way with grasp, task achievement and being on the same time robust to external disturbances. We do this by establishing physically meaningful constraints on the force level. In order to respect all constraints, we solve for a quadratic minimization problem (quadratic programming), yielding the required joint torque controls. Contrarily to most other approaches, we deal also with unilateral contacts (due to friction) as well as bilateral grasps which allow for example for arbitrarily steering or pulling on a handhold. Additionally, and in contrast to classical methods based on ZMP, we account also for contacts not all being in the same plane, as hand-wall contact. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

In this paper we present the first real-time realization of a unified NMPC and CLF controller on a robotic system with limited computational resources. These limitations motivate a set of approaches for efficiently incorporating CLF stability constraints into a general NMPC formulation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods compared to baseline CLF and NMPC controllers with a robotic Segway platform both in simulation and on hardware. The addition of a prediction horizon provides a performance advantage over CLF based controllers, which operate optimally point-wise in time. Moreover, the explicitly imposed stability constraints remove the need for difficult cost function and parameter tuning required by NMPC. Therefore the unified controller improves the performance of each isolated controller and simplifies the overall design process.},

@article{Singh2018,
abstract = {In the pursuit of real-time motion planning, a commonly adopted practice is to compute a trajectory by running a planning algorithm on a simplified, low-dimensional dynamical model, and then employ a feedback tracking controller that tracks such a trajectory by accounting for the full, high-dimensional system dynamics. While this strategy of planning with model mismatch generally yields fast computation times, there are no guarantees of dynamic feasibility, which hampers application to safety-critical systems. Building upon recent work that addressed this problem through the lens of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability, we devise an algorithmic framework whereby one computes, offline, for a pair of "planner" (i.e., low-dimensional) and "tracking" (i.e., high-dimensional) models, a feedback tracking controller and associated tracking bound. This bound is then used as a safety margin when generating motion plans via the low-dimensional model. Specifically, we harness the computational tool of sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to design a bilinear optimization algorithm for the computation of the feedback tracking controller and associated tracking bound. The algorithm is demonstrated via numerical experiments, with an emphasis on investigating the trade-off between the increased computational scalability afforded by SOS and its intrinsic conservativeness. Collectively, our results enable scaling the appealing strategy of planning with model mismatch to systems that are beyond the reach of HJ analysis, while maintaining safety guarantees.},

There are prohibitive design restrictions such as tight power budget and payload, which can particularly become important in aerial flights. To address these challenges, we pose a problem called the Mobility Value of Added Mass (MVAM) problem. In the MVAM problem, we attempt to allocate mass in our designs such that the energetic performance is affected the least. To solve the MVAM problem, we adopted a generative design approach using Grasshopper's evolutionary solver to synthesize a parametric design space for Husky. Then, this space was searched for the morphologies that could yield a minimized Total Cost Of Transport (TCOT) and payload. This approach revealed that a front-heavy quadrupedal robot can achieve a lower TCOT while retaining larger margins on allowable added mass to its design. Based on this framework Husky was built and tested as a front-heavy robot.},

Here we study the fundamental mechanics of the rotational stability of multi-body systems with the goal of identifying a general stability criterion. Our research focuses on H<sub>G</sub>, the rate of change of centroidal angular momentum of a robot, as the physical quantity containing its stability information. We propose three control strategies using H<sub>G</sub> that can be used for stability recapture of biped robots. For free walk on horizontal ground, a derived criterion refers to a point on the foot/ground surface of a robot where the total ground reaction force would have to act such that H<sub>G</sub>=0. This new criterion generalizes earlier concepts such as GCoM, CoP, ZMP, and FRI point, and extends their applicability.},

If the continuous problem has a sufficiently smooth solution and the Hamiltonian satisfies a strong convexity condition, then the discrete problem possesses a local minimizer in a neighborhood of the continuous solution, and as either the number of collocation points or the number of mesh intervals increase, the discrete solution convergences to the continuous solution in the sup-norm. The convergence is exponentially fast with respect to the degree of the polynomials on each mesh interval, while the error is bounded by a polynomial in the mesh spacing. An advantage of the $hp$-scheme over global polynomials is that there is a convergence guarantee when the mesh is sufficiently small, while the convergence result for global polynomials requires that a norm of the linearized dynamics is sufficiently small. Numerical examples explore the convergence theory.},

abstract = {While it has been repeatedly shown that learning-based controllers can provide superior performance, they often lack of safety guarantees. This paper aims at addressing this problem by introducing a model predictive safety certification (MPSC) scheme for polytopic linear systems with additive disturbances. The scheme verifies safety of a proposed learning-based input and modifies it as little as necessary in order to keep the system within a given set of constraints. Safety is thereby related to the existence of a model predictive controller (MPC) providing a feasible trajectory towards a safe target set. A robust MPC formulation accounts for the fact that the model is generally uncertain in the context of learning, which allows proving constraint satisfaction at all times under the proposed MPSC strategy. The MPSC scheme can be used in order to expand any potentially conservative set of safe states for learning and we prove an iterative technique for enlarging the safe set. Finally, a practical data-based design procedure for MPSC is proposed using scenario optimization.},

abstract = {Modern nonlinear control theory seeks to endow systems with properties of stability and safety, and have been deployed successfully in multiple domains. Despite this success, model uncertainty remains a significant challenge in synthesizing safe controllers, leading to degradation in the properties provided by the controllers. This paper develops a machine learning framework utilizing Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to reduce model uncertainty as it impact the safe behavior of a system. This approach iteratively collects data and updates a controller, ultimately achieving safe behavior. We validate this method in simulation and experimentally on a Segway platform.},

abstract = {In this paper we address a task-driven motion generation method that allows a humanoid robot to make whole-body motions including support polygon reshaping to achieve the given tasks. In the proposed method, generalized inverse kinematics (IK) is employed with floating-base to generate humanoid whole-body motions that enable the robot to accomplish the tasks according to given priorities. During the motion, several criteria such as manipulability or end-effector position error are tracked. If the desired task cannot be done because of those criteria, a geometric planner for support polygon is activated. Then the whole-body motion is computed again always using the generalized IK solver including stepping motion that realizes the deformed support polygon by using dynamic walking pattern generator. This method provides a way to perform tasks that could not be done without changing the humanoid's support state. We have verified the proposed framework through simulations and experiments using humanoid robot HRP-2},

abstract = {High quality simulations of the dynamics of soft flexible objects can be rather costly, because the assembly of internal forces through an often nonlinear stiffness at each time step is expensive. Many standard implicit integrators introduce significant, time-step dependent artificial damping. Here we propose and demonstrate the effectiveness of an exponential Rosenbrock-Euler (ERE) method which avoids discretization-dependent artificial damping. The method is relatively inexpensive and works well with the large time steps used in computer graphics. It retains correct qualitative behaviour even in challenging circumstances involving non-convex elastic energies. Our integrator is designed to handle and perform well even in the important cases where the symmetric stiffness matrix is not positive definite at all times. Thus we are able to address a wider range of practical situations than other related solvers. We show that our system performs efficiently for a wide range of soft materials.},

@article{Higham2005,
abstract = {The scaling and squaring method is the most widely used method for computing the matrix exponential, not least because it is the method implemented in the MATLAB function expm. The method scales the matrix by a power of 2 to reduce the norm to order 1, computes a Pad{\'{e}} approximant to the matrix exponential, and then repeatedly squares to undo the effect of the scaling. We give a new backward error analysis of the method (in exact arithmetic) that employs sharp bounds for the truncation errors and leads to an implementation of essentially optimal efficiency. We also give a new rounding error analysis that shows the computed Pad{\'{e}} approximant of the scaled matrix to be highly accurate. For IEEE double precision arithmetic the best choice of degree of Pad{\'{e}} approximant turns out to be 13, rather than the 6 or 8 used by previous authors. Our implementation of the scaling and squaring method always requires at least two fewer matrix multiplications than the expm function in MATLAB 7.0 when the matrix norm exceeds 1, which can amount to a 37% saving in the number of multiplications, and it is typically more accurate, owing to the fewer required squarings. We also investigate a different scaling and squaring algorithm proposed by Najfeld and Havel that employs a Pad{\'{e}} approximation to the function x coth (x). This method is found to be essentially a variation of the standard one with weaker supporting error analysis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

Put one feet forward so that you get a large support polygon, control horizontal COM back and forth

SQUAT BALANCE
Control 3d COM up and down to make robot squat

WALKING
Walking is created by sequencing four movements: (1) shifting the robot's weight to the right foot, (2) swinging the right foot forward, (3) shifting the weight back to the left foot, and (4) swinging the left foot forward.
Task Feasibility:
When the condition number of the foot grows beyond normal values we command the foot to step back within the reachable workspace to gain stability.

Computing kinematic and dynamic quantities in our control framework is computationally expensive for a realtime controller, with operations ranging from O(n) to O(n^3) of algorithmic complexity. To handle these computations in realtime, we implement two separate update loops. While feedback controllers are updated at servo rates, around 1KHz, kinematic and dynamic quantities that depend only on joint positions are updated at slow rates, normally around 20Hz to 50Hz. This dual update strategy is currently under test.

Because many humanoid robots are controlled through joint positions and not through torques, Khatib et al. recently developed a torque to position transformer (see Khatib, Thaulaud, and Park 2006). Here, joint positions are calculated through the transformation of torques based on the characterization of servo motor transfer functions.},

abstract = {In 1994 Karl Sims showed that computational evolution can produce interesting morphologies that resemble natural organisms. Despite nearly two decades of work since, evolved morphologies are not obviously more complex or natural, and the field seems to have hit a complexity ceiling. One hypothesis for the lack of increased complexity is that most work, including Sims', evolves morphologies composed of rigid elements, such as solid cubes and cylinders, limiting the design space. A second hypothesis is that the encodings of previous work have been overly regular, not allowing complex regularities with variation. Here we test both hypotheses by evolving soft robots with multiple materials and a powerful generative encoding called a compositional pattern-producing network (CPPN). Robots are selected for locomotion speed. We find that CPPNs evolve faster robots than a direct encoding and that the CPPN morphologies appear more natural. We also find that locomotion performance increases as more materials are added, that diversity of form and behavior can be increased with di↵erent cost functions without stifling performance, and that organisms can be evolved at di↵erent levels of resolution. These findings suggest the ability of generative soft-voxel systems to scale towards evolving a large diversity of complex, natural, multi-material creatures. Our results suggest that future work that combines the evolution of CPPNencoded soft, multi-material robots with modern diversityencouraging techniques could finally enable the creation of creatures far more complex and interesting than those produced by Sims nearly twenty years ago.},

abstract = {In this paper, a generalization of a formula proposed by Van Loan [Computing integrals involving the matrix exponential, IEEE Trans. Automat. Control 23 (1978) 395-404] for the computation of multiple integrals of exponential matrices is introduced. In this way, the numerical evaluation of such integrals is reduced to the use of a conventional algorithm to compute matrix exponentials. The formula is applied for evaluating some kinds of integrals that frequently emerge in a number classical mathematical subjects in the framework of differential equations, numerical methods and control engineering applications. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {Humanoid robots may require a degree of compliance at the joint level for improving efficiency, shock tolerance, and safe interaction with humans. The presence of joint elasticity, however, complexifies the design of balancing and walking controllers. This paper proposes a control framework for extending momentum based controllers developed for stiff actuators to the case of series elastic actuators. The key point is to consider the motor velocities as an intermediate control input, and then apply high-gain control to stabilise the desired motor velocities achieving momentum control. Simulations carried out on a model of the robot iCub verify the soundness of the proposed approach.},

Then the problem is solved by designing a regulator, based on the variable structure control, able to steer the state vector to the origin in minimum time, being compliant with all the constraints. With this purpose, a modular structure with a cascade of controllers, each one devoted to the regulation to the origin of a speciﬁc component of the state vector, is demonstrated to be effective and ideally suitable to cope with systems of any order.

abstract = {We introduce the first temporal-difference learning algorithms that converge with smooth value function approximators, such as neural networks. Conventional temporal-difference (TD) methods, such as TD($\lambda$), Q-learning and Sarsa have been used successfully with function approximation in many applications. However, it is well known that off-policy sampling, as well as nonlinear function approximation, can cause these algorithms to become unstable (i.e., the parameters of the approximator may diverge). Sutton et al. (2009a, 2009b) solved the problem of off-policy learning with linear TD algorithms by introducing a new objective function, related to the Bellman error, and algorithms that perform stochastic gradient-descent on this function. These methods can be viewed as natural generalizations to previous TD methods, as they converge to the same limit points when used with linear function approximation methods. We generalize this work to nonlinear function approximation. We present a Bellman error objective function and two gradient-descent TD algorithms that optimize it. We prove the asymptotic almost-sure convergence of both algorithms, for any finite Markov decision process and any smooth value function approximator, to a locally optimal solution. The algorithms are incremental and the computational complexity per time step scales linearly with the number of parameters of the approximator. Empirical results obtained in the game of Go demonstrate the algorithms' effectiveness.},

By using the MIMO terminal sliding mode technique and a few structural properties of rigid robotic manipulators, a robust controller can then be designed so that the output tracking error can converge to zero in a finite time, and strong robustness with respect to large uncertain dynamics can be guaranteed. It is also shown that the high gain of the terminal sliding mode controllers can be significantly reduced with respect to the one of the linear sliding mode controller where the sampling interval is nonzero},

@article{Shadmehr1994,
abstract = {We investigated how the CNS learns to control movements in different dynamical conditions, and how this learned behavior is represented. In particular, we considered the task of making reaching movements in the presence of externally imposed forces from a mechanical environment. This environment was a force field produced by a robot manipulandum, and the subjects made reaching movements while holding the end-effector of this manipulandum. Since the force field significantly changed the dynamics of the task, subjects' initial movements in the force field were grossly distorted compared to their movements in free space. However, with practice, hand trajectories in the force field converged to a path very similar to that observed in free space. This indicated that for reaching movements, there was a kinematic plan independent of dynamical conditions. The recovery of performance within the changed mechanical environment is motor adaptation. In order to investigate the mechanism underlying this adaptation, we considered the response to the sudden removal of the field after a training phase. The resulting trajectories, named aftereffects, were approximately mirror images of those that were observed when the subjects were initially exposed to the field. This suggested that the motor controller was gradually composing a model of the force field, a model that the nervous system used to predict and compensate for the forces imposed by the environment. In order to explore the structure of the model, we investigated whether adaptation to a force field, as presented in a small region, led to aftereffects in other regions of the workspace. We found that indeed there were aftereffects in workspace regions where no exposure to the field had taken place; that is, there was transfer beyond the boundary of the training data. This observation rules out the hypothesis that the subject's model of the force field was constructed as a narrow association between visited states and experienced forces; that is, adaptation was not via composition of a look-up table. In contrast, subjects modeled the force field by a combination of computational elements whose output was broadly tuned across the motor state space. These elements formed a model that extrapolated to outside the training region in a coordinate system similar to that of the joints and muscles rather than end-point forces. This geometric property suggests that the elements of the adaptive process represent dynamics of a motor task in terms of the intrinsic coordinate system of the sensors and actuators.},

@article{Lu2020,
abstract = {In robotic manufacturing, the machining vibration can easily affect the quality of the processed surfaces due to poor stiffness and variable stiffness of the robot arm. It is important to monitor the processing quality. Therefore, an online process monitor method for robotic grinding is proposed in this article. Since the surface quality is difficult to be measured directly online, a vibration-surface quality map is proposed to show the mapping relationship between the vibration signals and the surface images. Based on this map, the grinding states are classified to lack, normal, and overgrinding, which formed the training set data. Then a convolutional neural network classifier is trained to detect the grinding states during robotic machining only with the vibration signals. To establish the vibration-surface quality map, the symmetrized dot pattern and sparse autoencoder methods are utilized to extract the features from the raw vibrations and images data, and a gray-level co-occurrence matrix index is further used to build the bridge between them.

abstract = {In physics-based animation linear complementarity problems (LCPs) have historically been used as models of contact forces between rigid bodies. Re- cently LCPs are being deployed for other types of animation like deformable models, fluids, and granular material. Thus, LCPs are becoming a general important fundamental model. Hence, there is a real need for providing the numerical foundation for solving LCPs with numerical methods that are suitable for computer graphics. This is the void that these course notes tries to fill out – providing a toolbox of solutions for people in physics-based animation. The contribution of these notes is twofold. First, we explain the nature of LCPs and discuss the properties of the LCPs encountered in physics-based animation. Second, we present a range of numerical meth- ods for solving the LCPs. To help make our results available to others we supplement our course notes with Matlab implementations of all iterative methods discussed. Keywords:},

The key idea is to perform a parametrization of the feasible joint space in terms of exogenous states. It follows that the control of these states allows for joint limit avoidance. One of the main outcomes of this paper is that position terms in control laws are replaced by parametrized terms, where joint limits must be avoided. Stability and convergence of time-varying reference trajectories obtained with the proposed method are demonstrated to be in the sense of Lyapunov. The introduced control laws are verified by carrying out experiments on two degrees-of-freedom of the humanoid robot iCub.},

abstract = {This paper targets the efficient construction of a safety shield for decision making in scenarios that incorporate uncertainty. Markov decision processes (MDPs) are prominent models to capture such planning problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning technique to determine near-optimal policies in MDPs that may be unknown prior to exploring the model. However, during exploration, RL is prone to induce behavior that is undesirable or not allowed in safety- or mission-critical contexts. We introduce the concept of a probabilistic shield that enables decision-making to adhere to safety constraints with high probability. In a separation of concerns, we employ formal verification to efficiently compute the probabilities of critical decisions within a safety-relevant fragment of the MDP. We use these results to realize a shield that is applied to an RL algorithm which then optimizes the actual performance objective. We discuss tradeoffs between sufficient progress in exploration of the environment and ensuring safety. In our experiments, we demonstrate on the arcade game PAC-MAN and on a case study involving service robots that the learning efficiency increases as the learning needs orders of magnitude fewer episodes.},

In this paper, a general model is derived to mathematically describe the concurrent design of a mechatronic system. Based on this model, a concurrent engineering approach, called design for control (DFC), is formally presented for mechatronic systems design. Compared to other mechatronic design methodologies, DFC emphasizes obtaining a simple dynamic model of the mechanical structure by a judicious structure design and a careful selection of mechanical parameters. Once the simple dynamic model is available, in spite of the complexity of the mechanical structure, the controller design can be facilitated and better control performance can be achieved. Four design scenarios in application of DFC are addressed. A case study is implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of DFC through the design and control of a programmable four-bar linkage},

abstract = {While legged animals are adept at traversing rough landscapes, it remains a very challenging task for a legged robot to negotiate unknown terrain. Control systems for legged robots are plagued by dynamic constraints from underactuation, actuator power limits, and frictional ground contact; rather than relying purely on disturbance rejection, considerable advantage can be obtained by planning nominal trajectories which are more easily stabilized. In this paper, we present an approach for designing nominal periodic trajectories for legged robots that maximize a measure of robustness against uncertainty in the geometry of the terrain. We propose a direct collocation method which solves simultaneously for a nominal periodic control input, for many possible one-step solution trajectories (using ground profiles drawn from a distribution over terrain), and for the periodic solution to a jump Riccati equation which provides an expected infinite-horizon cost-to-go for each of these samples. We demonstrate that this trajectory optimization scheme can recover the known deadbeat open-loop control solution for the Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) on unknown terrain. Moreover, we demonstrate that it generalizes to other models like the bipedal compass gait walker, resulting in a dramatic increase in the number of steps taken over moderate terrain when compared against a limit cycle optimized for efficiency only. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

They have important benefits but to the best of our knowledge have never been implemented on a torque controlled humanoid where model inaccuracies, sensor noise and real-time computation requirements can be problematic. Using a reformulation of existing algorithms, we propose a simplification of the problem that allows to achieve real-time control. Momentum-based control is integrated in the task hierarchy and a LQR design approach is used to compute the desired associated closed-loop behavior and improve performance. Extensive experiments on various balancing and tracking tasks show very robust performance in the face of unknown disturbances, even when the humanoid is standing on one foot. Our results demonstrate that hierarchical inverse dynamics together with momentum control can be efficiently used for feedback control under real robot conditions.},

abstract = {Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) allows an agent to discover good policies with a small number of trials by generalising observed transitions. Data efficiency can be further improved with a probabilistic model of the agent's ignorance about the world, allowing it to choose actions under uncertainty. Bayesian modelling offers tools for this task, with PILCO [1] being a prominent example, achieving state-of-the-art data efficiency on low dimensional RL benchmarks. But PILCO relies on Gaussian processes (GPs), which prohibits its applicability to problems that require a larger number of trials to be solved. Further, PILCO does not consider temporal correlation in model uncertainty between successive state transitions, which results in PILCO underestimating state uncertainty at future time steps [2]. In this paper we extend PILCO's framework to use Bayesian deep dynamics models with approximate variational inference, allowing PILCO to scale linearly with number of trials and observation space dimensionality. Using particle methods we sample dynamics function realisations, and obtain lower cumulative cost than PILCO. We give insights into the modelling assumptions made in PILCO, and show that moment matching is a crucial sim-plifying assumption made by the model. Our implementation can leverage GPU architectures, offering faster running time than PILCO, and will allow structured observation spaces to be modelled (images or higher dimensional inputs) in the future.},

Prioritized control is a widespread multi-task technique in robotics and animation: tasks have strict priorities and they are satisfied only as long as they do not conflict with any higher-priority task. Optimal control instead formulates an optimization problem whose solution is either a feedback control policy or a feedforward trajectory of control inputs. We introduce strict priorities in multi-task optimal control problems, as an alternative to weighting task errors proportionally to their importance. This ensures the respect of the specified priorities, while avoiding numerical conditioning issues. We compared our approach with both prioritized control and optimal control with tests on a simulated robot with 11 degrees of freedom.},

By considering the infinitesimal displacement and the moment acting on the convex hull of the supporting points, we show that our method for determining the region of ZMP can be applicable to several cases of the arm/leg coordination tasks. We first express two kinds of ZMPs for such coordination tasks, i.e., the conventional ZMP, and the "generalized zero moment point (GZMP)" which is a generalization of the ZMP to the arm/leg coordination tasks. By projecting the edges of the convex hull of the supporting points onto the floor, we show that the position and the region of the GZMP for keeping the dynamical balance can be uniquely obtained.

@article{Deori2020,
abstract = {We consider a linear system affected by an additive stochastic disturbance and address the design of a finite horizon control policy that is optimal according to some cost criterion and accounts also for probabilistic constraints on both the input and state variables. The resulting policy can be implemented over a receding horizon according to the model predictive control strategy. Such a possibility, however, is hampered by the fact that a feasibility issue may arise when recomputing the policy. Infeasibility indeed can occur if the disturbance has unbounded support and the state is required to remain in a bounded set. In this paper, we propose a solution to this issue that is based on the introduction of a constraint relaxation that becomes effective only when the original problem turns out to be unfeasible. This is obtained via a cascade of two probabilistically-constrained optimization problems where, in the first one, performance is neglected and the policy is designed to fully recover feasibility or – if this is not possible – to determine the minimum level of relaxation which is needed to recover feasibility; in the second step, such a minimum relaxation level is imposed while optimally (re-)tuning the control policy parameters. Both problems are solved through a computationally tractable scenario-based scheme using a finite number of disturbance realizations and providing an approximate solution that satisfies with high confidence the original probabilistic constraints of the cascade.},

abstract = {Many science and engineering applications feature non-convex optimization problems where the objective function can not be handled analytically, i.e. it is a black box. Examples include design optimization via experiments, or via costly finite elements simulations. To solve these problems, global optimization routines are used. These iterative techniques must trade-off exploitation close to the current best point with exploration of unseen regions of the search space. In this respect, a new global optimization strategy based on a Set Membership (SM) framework is proposed. Assuming Lipschitz continuity of the cost function, the approach employs SM concepts to decide whether to switch from an exploitation mode to an exploration one, and vice-versa. The resulting algorithm, named SMGO (Set Membership Global Optimization) is presented. Theoretical properties regarding convergence and computational complexity are derived, and implementation aspects are discussed. Finally, the SMGO performance is evaluated on a set of benchmark non-convex problems and compared with those of other global optimization approaches.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE. Generating diverse behaviors with a humanoid robot requires a mix of human supervision and automatic control. Ideally, the user's input is restricted to high-level instruction and guidance, and the controller is intelligent enough to accomplish the tasks autonomously. Here we describe an integrated system that achieves this goal. The automatic controller is based on real-time model-predictive control (MPC) applied to the full dynamics of the robot. This is possible due to the speed of our new physics engine (MuJoCo), the efficiency of our trajectory optimization algorithm, and the contact smoothing methods we have developed for the purpose of control optimization. In our system, the operator specifies subtasks by selecting from a menu of predefined cost functions, and optionally adjusting the mixing weights of the different cost terms in runtime. The resulting composite cost is sent to the MPC machinery which constructs a new locally-optimal time-varying linear feedback control law once every 30 msec, while planning 500 msec into the future. This control law is evaluated at 1 kHz to generate control signals for the robot, until the next control law becomes available. Performance is illustrated on a subset of the tasks from the DARPA Virtual Robotics Challenge.},

In the proposed approach, centroidal momentum terms are excluded in favor of a hierarchy of high-priority position and orientation tasks and a low-priority postural task. More specifically, the controller stabilizes the position of the center of mass, the orientation of the pelvis frame, as well as the position and orientation of the feet frames. The low-priority postural task provides reference positions for each joint of the robot. Joint torques and contact forces to stabilize tasks are obtained through quadratic programming optimization. Besides the exclusion of centroidal momentum terms, part of the novelty of the approach lies in the definition of control laws in SE(3) which do not require the use of Euler parameterization. Validation of the framework was achieved in a scenario where the robot kept balance while walking in place. Experiments have been conducted with the iCub robot, in simulation and in real-world experiments.},

This paper introduces a locomotion system that generates high-quality animation of agile movements using nonlinear controllers that plan through such contact changes. We demonstrate the general applicability of this approach by emulating walking and running motions in rigid-body simulations. Then we consolidate these controllers under a higher-level planner that interactively controls the character's direction.},

abstract = {Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable robots to acquire new skills much more quickly, by leveraging prior experience to learn how to learn. However, much of the current research on meta-reinforcement learning focuses on task distributions that are very narrow. For example, a commonly used meta-reinforcement learning benchmark uses different running velocities for a simulated robot as different tasks. When policies are meta-trained on such narrow task distributions, they cannot possibly generalize to more quickly acquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the aim of these methods is to enable faster acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we must evaluate them on task distributions that are sufficiently broad to enable generalization to new behaviors. In this paper, we propose an open-source simulated benchmark for meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning consisting of 50 distinct robotic manipulation tasks. Our aim is to make it possible to develop algorithms that generalize to accelerate the acquisition of entirely new, held-out tasks. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning algorithms on these tasks. Surprisingly, while each task and its variations (e.g., with different object positions) can be learned with reasonable success, these algorithms struggle to learn with multiple tasks at the same time, even with as few as ten distinct training tasks. Our analysis and open-source environments pave the way for future research in multi-task learning and meta-learning that can enable meaningful generalization, thereby unlocking the full potential of these methods.},

Redundant constraints do not pose numerical problems or require regularization. Coulomb friction for contact is modeled using a true friction cone, rather than a linearized approximation. The computational expense of the solver is dependent upon the types of constraints present in the input. The hardest (in a computational complexity sense) inputs are reducible to solving convex optimization problems, i.e., polynomial time solvable. The simplest inputs require only solving a linear system. The solver is L-stable, which will imply that the forces due to constraints induce no computational stiffness into the multi-body dynamics differential equations. This approach is targeted to multibodies simulated with coarse accuracy, subject to computational stiffness arising from constraints, and where the number of constraint equations is not large compared to the number of multibody position and velocity state variables. For such applications, the approach should prove far faster than using other implicit integration approaches. I assess the approach on some fundamental multibody dynamics problems.},

Leveraging mathematical equivalence between distributionally robust control and risk-sensitive optimal control, our framework also provides an algorithm to dynamically adjust the risk-sensitivity level online for risk-sensitive control.

abstract = {Set invariance plays a fundamental role in the design of control systems for constrained systems since the constraints can be satisfied for all time if and only if the initial state is contained inside an invariant set. This thesis is concerned with robust set invariance theory and its application to guaranteeing feasibility in model predictive control. In the first part of this thesis, some of the main ideas in set invariance theory are brought together and placed in a general, nonlinear setting. The key ingredients in computing robust controllable and invariant sets are identified and discussed. Following this, linear systems with parametric uncertainty and state disturbances are considered and algorithms for computing the respective robust controllable and invariant sets are described. In addition to discussing linear systems, an algorithm for computing the robust controllable sets for piecewise affine systems with state disturbances is described. In the second part, the ideas from set invariance are applied to the problem of guaranteeing feasibility and robust constraint satisfaction in Model Predictive Control (MPC). A new sufficient condition is derived for guaranteeing feasibility of a givenMPC scheme. The effect of the choice of horizons and constraints on the feasible set of the MPC controller is also investigated. Following this, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for determining whether a givenMPCcontroller is robustly feasible. The use of a robustness constraint for designing robust MPC controllers is discussed and it is shown how this proposed scheme can be used to guarantee robust constraint satisfaction for linear systems with parametric uncertainty and state disturbances. A new necessary and sufficient condition as well as some new sufficient conditions are derived for guaranteeing that the proposed MPC scheme is robustly feasible. The third part of this thesis is concerned with recovering from constraint violations. An algorithm is presented for designing soft-constrained MPC controllers which guarantee constraint satisfaction, if possible. Finally, a mixed-integer programming approach is described for finding a solution which minimises the number of violations in a set of prioritised constraints.},

abstract = {As locomotion decisions must be taken by considering the future, most existing quadruped controllers are based on a model predictive controller (MPC) with a reduced model of the dynamics to generate the motion, followed by a second whole-body controller to follow the movement. Yet the choice of the considered reduction in the MPC is often ad-hoc or decided by intuition. In this article, we focus on particular MPCs and analyze the effect of the reduced models on the robot behavior. Based on existing formulations, we offer additional controllers to better understand the influence of the reductions in the controller capabilities. Finally, we propose a robust predictive controller capable of optimizing the foot placements, gait period, center-of-mass trajectory and corresponding ground reaction forces. The behavior of these controllers is statistically evaluated in simulation. This empirical study is a basis for understanding the relative importance of the components of the optimal control problem (variables, costs, dynamics), that are sometimes arbitrarily emphasized or neglected. We also provide a qualitative study in simulation and on the real robot Solo.},

We present risk-sensitive and cost- cumulant solutions for this problem for non-linear dynamics and non-quadratic costs. Locally optimal solutions are found by iteratively performing a linear quadratic approximation around a nominal trajectory, solving the local problemand updating the trajectory until convergence. Simulation results of a point mass robot and a two-link manipulator validate the applicability of the proposed approach and illustrate its peculiarities.},

In domains sparsely populated by obstacles, the heuristics used by sampling-based planners to navigate narrow passages can be needlessly complex; furthermore, additional post-processing is required to remove the jerky or extraneous motions from the paths that such planners generate. In this paper, we present CHOMP, a novel method for continuous path refinement that uses covariant gradient techniques to improve the quality of sampled trajectories. Our optimization technique both optimizes higher-order dynamics and is able to converge over a wider range of input paths relative to previous path optimization strategies. In particular, we relax the collision-free feasibility prerequisite on input paths required by those strategies. As a result, CHOMP can be used as a standalone motion planner in many real-world planning queries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in manipulation planning for a 6-DOF robotic arm as well as in trajectory generation for a walking quadruped robot.},

start with forces that meet the required body forces and torques but may

However, some difficulties remain to be dealt with, particularly about the implementation of fast and dynamic walking gaits, in other words anthropomorphic gaits, especially on uneven terrain. In this perspective, both concepts of center of pressure (CoP) and zero moment point (ZMP) are obviously useful. In this paper, the two concepts are strictly defined, the CoP with respect to ground-feet contact forces, the ZMP with respect to gravity plus inertia forces. Then, the coincidence of CoP and ZMP is proven, and related control aspects are examined. Finally, a virtual CoP-ZMP is defined, allowing us to extend the concept when walking on uneven terrain. This paper is a theoretical study. Experimental results are presented in a companion paper, analyzing the evolution of the ground contact forces obtained from a human walker wearing robot feet as shoes.},

abstract = {We propose a framework for provably stable local control of multi-contact robotic systems, directly utilizing force measurements and exploiting the complementarity structure of contact dynamics. Since many robotic tasks, like manipulation and locomotion, are fundamentally based in making and breaking contact with the environment, state-of-the-art control policies struggle to deal with the hybrid nature of multi-contact motion. Such controllers often rely heavily upon heuristics or, due to the combinatoric structure in the dynamics, are unsuitable for real-time control. Principled deployment of tactile sensors offers a promising mechanism for stable and robust control, but modern approaches often use this data in an ad hoc manner, for instance to guide guarded moves. In this work, we present a control framework which can close the loop on tactile sensors. Critically, this framework is non-combinatoric, enabling optimization algorithms to automatically synthesize provably stable control policies. We demonstrate this approach on multiple examples, including underactuated multi-contact problems, quasi-static friction problems and a high-dimensional problem with ten contacts.},

In this article we describe a MATLAB1 package which aims to facilitate the quick deployment and testing of exponential integrators, of Runge - Kutta, multistep, and general linear type. A large number of integrators are included in this package along with several well-known examples. The so-called $\phi$ functions and their evaluation is crucial for accuracy, stability, and efficiency of exponential integrators, and the approach taken here is through a modification of the scaling and squaring technique, the most common approach used for computing the matrix exponential. {\textcopyright} 2007 ACM.},

This issue is especially important for humanoid robots carrying out demanding movements such as walking in irregular surfaces, running or practicing a given sport (e.g. soccer). In a former contribution we have addressed the design of low-damage fall sequences, which can be activated/triggered by the robot in case of a detected unintentional fall or an intentional fall (common situation in robot soccer). In this article we tackle the detection of instability and the avoidance of falls in biped humanoids, as well as the integration of all components in a single framework. In this framework a fall can be avoided or a falling sequence can be triggered depending on the detected instability's degree. The proposed fall detection and fall avoidance subsystems are validated in real world-experiments with biped humanoid robots.},

abstract = {The control of complex systems faces a trade-off between high performance and safety guarantees, which in particular restricts the application of learning-based methods to safety-critical systems. A recently proposed framework to address this issue is the use of a safety controller, which guarantees to keep the system within a safe region of the state space. This paper introduces efficient techniques for the synthesis of a safe set and control law, which offer improved scalability properties by relying on approximations based on convex optimization problems. The first proposed method requires only an approximate linear system model and Lipschitz continuity of the unknown nonlinear dynamics. The second method extends the results by showing how a Gaussian process prior on the unknown system dynamics can be used in order to reduce conservatism of the resulting safe set. We demonstrate the results with numerical examples, including an autonomous convoy of vehicles.},

Model predictive control (MPC), as the prime methodology for constrained control, offers a significant opportunity to exploit the abundance of data in a reliable manner, particularly while taking safety constraints into account. This review aims at summarizing and categorizing previous research on learning-based MPC, i.e., the integration or combination of MPC with learning methods, for which we consider three main categories. Most of the research addresses learning for automatic improvement of the prediction model from recorded data. There is, however, also an increasing interest in techniques to infer the parameterization of the MPC controller, i.e., the cost and constraints, that lead to the best closed-loop performance. Finally, we discuss concepts that leverage MPC to augment learning-based controllers with constraint satisfaction properties.},

@article{Wolpert2005,
abstract = { Recent work on the foundational underpinnings of black-box optimization has begun to uncover a rich mathematical structure. In particular, it is now known that an inner product between the optimization algorithm and the distribution of optimization problems likely to be encountered fixes the distribution over likely performances in running that algorithm. One ramification of this is the "No Free Lunch" (NFL) theorems, which state that any two algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems. This highlights the need for exploiting problem-specific knowledge to achieve better than random performance. In this paper, we present a general framework covering most optimization scenarios. In addition to the optimization scenarios addressed in the NFL results, this framework covers multiarmed bandit problems and evolution of multiple coevolving players. As a particular instance of the latter, it covers "self-play" problems. In these problems, the set of players work together to produce a champion, who then engages one or more antagonists in a subsequent multiplayer game. In contrast to the traditional optimization case where the NFL results hold, we show that in self-play there are free lunches: in coevolution some algorithms have better performance than other algorithms, averaged across all possible problems. However, in the typical coevolutionary scenarios encountered in biology, where there is no champion, the NFL theorems still hold.},

This is due to the difficulty of computing invariant sets and control Lyapunov functions for general nonlinear systems. In this paper we propose a novel method for computing time–varying terminal costs and sets by means of first order or second order Taylor approximations of the nonlinear system dynamics. The method first solves a set of linear matrix inequalities to compute the terminal ingredients for the approximated dynamics. Then, a small scale global nonlinear optimization problem is solved to check the validity of the terminal ingredients for the nonlinear dynamics. The proposed method also allows for time–varying linear or nonlinear terminal control laws. The developed method can result in significant enlargements of the domain of attraction of the nonlinear MPC closed–loop system, as demonstrated by a benchmark academic example.},

The idea is to handle a collision at a generic point along the robot as a fault of its actuating system. A previously developed dynamic FDI (fault detection and isolation) technique is used, which does not require acceleration or force measurements. The actual robot link that has collided can also be identified. Once contact has been detected, it is possible to switch to a suitably defined hybrid force/motion controller that enables to keep the contact, while sliding on the obstacle, and to regulate the interaction force. Simulation results are shown for a two-link planar robot.},

Our formulation directly represents the rotational dynamics using the rotation matrix, which liberates us from the issues associated with the use of Euler angles and quaternion as the orientation representations. With a variation-based linearization scheme and a carefully constructed cost function, the MPC control law is transcribed to the standard Quadratic Program (QP) form. The MPC controller can operate at real-time rates of 250 Hz on a quadruped robot. Experimental results including periodic quadrupedal gaits and a controlled backflip validate that our control strategy could stabilize dynamic motions that involve singularity in 3D maneuvers.},

Classical explicit numerical integration schemes have the shortcoming that the stepsizes are limited by the highest frequency that occurs within the solution spectrum of the governing equations, while implicit methods suffer from an inevitable and mostly uncontrollable artificial viscosity that often leads to a nonphysical behavior. In order to overcome these specific detriments, we devise an appropriate class of exponential integrators that solve the stiff part of the governing equations of motion by employing a closed-form solution. As a consequence, we are able to handle up to three orders of magnitude larger time-steps as with conventional implicit integrators and at the same time achieve a tremendous increase in the overall long-term stability due to a strict energy conservation. The advantageous behavior of our approach is demonstrated on a broad spectrum of complex deformablemodels like fibers, textiles, and solids, including collision response, friction, and damping. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM 0730-0301/2014/01-ART3 15.00.},

We give a new backward error analysis of the method (in exact arithmetic) that employs sharp bounds for the truncation errors and leads to an implementation of essentially optimal efficiency. We also give a new rounding error analysis that shows the computed Pad{\'{e}} approximant of the scaled matrix to be highly accurate. For IEEE double precision arithmetic the best choice of degree of Pad{\'{e}} approximant turns out to be 13, rather than the 6 or 8 used by previous authors. Our implementation of the scaling and squaring method always requires at least two fewer matrix multiplications than the expm function in MATLAB 7.0 when the matrix norm exceeds 1, which can amount to a 37% saving in the number of multiplications, and it is typically more accurate, owing to the fewer required squarings. We also investigate a different scaling and squaring algorithm proposed by Najfeld and Havel that employs a Pad{\'{e}} approximation to the function x coth (x). This method is found to be essentially a variation of the standard one with weaker supporting error analysis. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) is a popular variant of Stochastic Gradient Descent, where properly scaled isotropic Gaussian noise is added to an unbiased estimate of the gradient at each iteration. This modest change allows SGLD to escape local minima and suffices to guarantee asymptotic convergence to global minimizers for sufficiently regular non-convex objectives (Gelfand and Mitter, 1991). The present work provides a nonasymptotic analysis in the context of non-convex learning problems, giving finite-time guarantees for SGLD to find approximate minimizers of both empirical and population risks. As in the asymptotic setting, our analysis relates the discrete-time SGLD Markov chain to a continuous-time diffusion process. A new tool that drives the results is the use of weighted transportation cost inequalities to quantify the rate of convergence of SGLD to a stationary distribution in the Euclidean $2$-Wasserstein distance.},

Concretely, we introduce new transformers for affine transforms, the rectified linear unit (ReLU), sigmoid, tanh, and maxpool functions. We implemented our method in a system called DeepPoly and evaluated it extensively on a range of datasets, neural architectures (including defended networks), and specifications. Our experimental results indicate that DeepPoly is more precise than prior work while scaling to large networks. We also show how to combine DeepPoly with a form of abstraction refinement based on trace partitioning. This enables us to prove, for the first time, the robustness of the network when the input image is subjected to complex perturbations such as rotations that employ linear interpolation.},

In this manuscript, we show that this framework can introduce equilibrium points (particularly at the boundary of the unsafe set) other than the minimum of the Lyapunov function into the closed-loop system. We derive explicit conditions under which these undesired equilibria (which can even appear in the simple case of linear systems with just one convex unsafe set) are asymptotically stable. To address this issue, we propose an extension to the QP-based controller unifying CLFs and CBFs that explicitly avoids undesirable equilibria on the boundary of the safe set. The solution is illustrated in the design of a collision-free controller.},

abstract = {— Robust control theory studies the effect of noise, disturbances, and other uncertainty on system performance. Despite growing recognition across science and engineering that robustness and efficiency tradeoffs dominate the evolution and design of complex systems, the use of robust control theory remains limited, partly because the mathematics involved is rel-atively inaccessible to nonexperts, and the important concepts have been inexplicable without a fairly rich mathematics back-ground. This paper aims to begin changing that by presenting the most essential concepts in robust control using human stick balancing, a simple case study popular in both the sensorimotor control literature and extremely familiar to engineers. With minimal and familiar models and mathematics, we can explore the impact of unstable poles and zeros, delays, and noise, which can then be easily verified with simple experiments using a standard extensible pointer. Despite its simplicity, this case study has extremes of robustness and fragility that are initially counter-intuitive but for which simple mathematics and experiments are clear and compelling. The theory used here has been well-known for many decades, and the cart-pendulum example is a standard in undergrad controls courses, yet a careful reconsidering of both leads to striking new insights that we argue are of great pedagogical value.},

The first stage generates a twice-differentiable interpolating path that obeys kinematic contact constraints up to a user-specified tolerance. The second stage optimizes speeds along the path to minimize time while satisfying dynamic constraints. The method supports velocity, acceleration, and torque constraints, and polyhedral contact friction constraints at an arbitrary number of contact points. The method is numerically stable, and empirical running time is weakly linear in the number of degrees of freedom and polynomial in the time-domain grid resolution. Experiments demonstrate that full-body motions for robots with 100 degrees of freedom and dozens of contact points are calculated in seconds.},

abstract = {Reachability analysis provides formal guarantees for performance and safety properties of nonlinear control systems. Here, one aims to compute the backward reachable set (BRS) or tube (BRT) - the set of states from which the system can be driven into a target set at a particular time or within a time interval, respectively. The computational complexity of current approaches scales poorly, making application to high-dimensional systems intractable. We propose a technique that decomposes the dynamics of a general class of nonlinear systems into subsystems which may be coupled through common states, controls, and disturbances. Despite this coupling, BRSs and BRTs can be computed efficiently using our technique without incurring additional approximation errors and without the need for linearizing dynamics or approximating sets as polytopes. Computations of BRSs and BRTs now become orders of magnitude faster, and for the first time BRSs and BRTs for many high-dimensional nonlinear control systems can be computed using the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. In situations involving bounded adversarial disturbances, our proposed method can obtain slightly conservative results. We demonstrate our theory by numerically computing BRSs and BRTs for several systems, including the six-dimensional Acrobatic Quadrotor using the HJ formulation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE. Identification of inertial parameters is fundamental for the implementation of torque-based control in humanoids. At the same time, good models of friction and actuator dynamics are critical for the low-level control of joint torques. We propose a novel method to identify inertial, friction and motor parameters in a single procedure. The identification exploits the measurements of the PWM of the DC motors and a 6-axis force/torque sensor mounted inside the kinematic chain. The partial least-square (PLS) method is used to perform the regression. We identified the inertial, friction and motor parameters of the right arm of the iCub humanoid robot. We verified that the identified model can accurately predict the force/torque sensor measurements and the motor voltages. Moreover, we compared the identified parameters against the CAD parameters, in the prediction of the force/torque sensor measurements. Finally, we showed that the estimated model can effectively detect external contacts, comparing it against a tactile-based contact detection. The presented approach offers some advantages with respect to other state-of-the-art methods, because of its completeness (i.e. it identifies inertial, friction and motor parameters) and simplicity (only one data collection, with no particular requirements).},

In particular, the ability to autonomously select foot placement positions to avoid obstacles while walking is an important step towards improved navigation autonomy for humanoids. We present a footstep planner for the Honda ASIMO humanoid robot that plans a sequence of footstep positions to navigate toward a goal location while avoiding obstacles. The possible future foot placement positions are dependent on the current state of the robot. Using a finite set of state-dependent actions, we use an A* search to compute optimal sequences of footstep locations up to a time-limited planning horizon. We present experimental results demonstrating the robot navigating through both static and dynamic known environments that include obstacles moving on predictable trajectories. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

Decision-makers can be risk-sensitive with respect to this uncertainty in that they may not only consider the average payoff of an outcome, but also consider the variability of the payoffs. Although such risk-sensitivity is a well-established phenomenon in psychology and economics, it has been much less studied in motor control. In fact, leading theories of motor control, such as optimal feedback control, assume that motor behaviors can be explained as the optimization of a given expected payoff or cost. Here we review evidence that humans exhibit risk-sensitivity in their motor behaviors, thereby demonstrating sensitivity to the variability of "motor costs." Furthermore, we discuss how risk-sensitivity can be incorporated into optimal feedback control models of motor control. We conclude that risk-sensitivity is an important concept in understanding individual motor behavior under uncertainty.},

abstract = {A Lie group is an old mathematical abstract object dating back to the XIX century, when mathematician Sophus Lie laid the foundations of the theory of continuous transformation groups. As it often happens, its usage has spread over diverse areas of science and technology many years later. In robotics, we are recently experiencing an important trend in its usage, at least in the fields of estimation, and particularly in motion estimation for navigation. Yet for a vast majority of roboticians, Lie groups are highly abstract constructions and therefore difficult to understand and to use. This may be due to the fact that most of the literature on Lie theory is written by and for mathematicians and physicists, who might be more used than us to the deep abstractions this theory deals with. In estimation for robotics it is often not necessary to exploit the full capacity of the theory, and therefore an effort of selection of materials is required. In this paper, we will walk through the most basic principles of the Lie theory, with the aim of conveying clear and useful ideas, and leave a significant corpus of the Lie theory behind. Even with this mutilation, the material included here has proven to be extremely useful in modern estimation algorithms for robotics, especially in the fields of SLAM, visual odometry, and the like. Alongside this micro Lie theory, we provide a chapter with a few application examples, and a vast reference of formulas for the major Lie groups used in robotics, including most jacobian matrices and the way to easily manipulate them. We also present a new C++ template-only library implementing all the functionality described here.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.The majority of methods developed for generating locomotion plans for bipedal robots are based upon the linear inverted pendulum model. While this simplified model has proven useful, it possesses certain theoretical limitations such as the inability to account for changes in the height of the center of mass or the effects of angular momentum, the latter of which can be useful for recovering from disturbances and in balancing. It is shown in this paper that if we assume that the robot is closely following a known reference signal for the center of mass height, the equations of motion are linear in the position of the center of pressure and the rate of change of angular momentum about the center of mass. With the dynamics linear in these particular quantities, model predictive control is used to solve for control inputs over a receding horizon resulting in reference trajectories for the center of pressure and the rate of change of angular momentum about the center of mass. Examples are presented for undisturbed walking, double support push recovery, and one leg balancing that utilize the effects of angular momentum while remaining dynamically consistent with a reference signal for the height of the center of mass and regulating critical ground reference points for ensuring the maintenance of postural stability.},

abstract = {Quasistatic legged locomotion over uneven terrains requires characterization of the mechanism's feasible equilibrium postures. This paper characterizes the feasible equilibrium postures of mechanisms supported by three frictional point contacts in a three-dimensional gravitational environment, for a subclass of contact arrangements, called tame , for which the friction cones lie above the plane spanned by the contacts. The kinematic structure of the mechanism is lumped into a single rigid body Β having the same contacts with the environment and a variable center of mass. The equilibrium postures associated with a given set of contacts become the center-of-mass locations of Β that maintain a feasible equilibrium with respect to gravity. The paper establishes the relations between the feasible equilibrium region and the classical support polygon principle. For tame 3-contact arrangements, the paper identifies and characterizes geometrically three types of boundary curves of the feasible equilibrium region, where two of them are obtained is closed-from, and the third is given implicitly as a solution of a set of nonlinear equations, which can be traced numerically. The three types of boundary curves are then associated with the onset of three different modes of non-static contact motions. Finally, the paper reports on experimental results that verify the theoretical predictions by using a 3-legged prototype.},

abstract = {This paper presents the methodology used to achieve efficient and dynamic walking behaviors on the prototype humanoid robotics platform, DURUS. As a means of providing a hardware platform capable of these behaviors, the design of DURUS combines highly efficient electromechanical components with control in the loop design of the leg morphology. Utilizing the final design of DURUS, a formal framework for the generation of dynamic walking gaits which maximizes efficiency by exploiting the full body dynamics of the robot, including the interplay between the passive and active elements, is developed. The gaits generated through this methodology form the basis of the control implementation experimentally realized on DURUS; in particular, the trajectories generated through the formal framework yield a feedforward control input which is modulated by feedback in the form of regulators that compensate for discrepancies between the model and physical system. The end result of the unified approach to control-informed mechanical design, formal gait design and regulator-based feedback control implementation is efficient and dynamic locomotion on the humanoid robot DURUS. In particular, DURUS was able to demonstrate dynamic locomotion at the DRC Finals Endurance Test, walking for just under five hours in a single day, traveling 3.9 km with a mean cost of transport of 1.61-the lowest reported cost of transport achieved on a bipedal humanoid robot.},

@article{Fahmi2019,
abstract = {Whole-body Control (WBC) has emerged as an important framework in locomotion control for legged robots. However, most of WBC frameworks fail to generalize beyond rigid terrains. Legged locomotion over soft terrain is difficult due to the presence of unmodeled contact dynamics that WBCs do not account for. This introduces uncertainty in locomotion and affects the stability and performance of the system. In this paper, we propose a novel soft terrain adaptation algorithm called STANCE: Soft Terrain Adaptation and Compliance Estimation. STANCE consists of a WBC that exploits the knowledge of the terrain to generate an optimal solution that is contact consistent and an online terrain compliance estimator that provides the WBC with terrain knowledge. We validated STANCE both in simulation and experiment on the Hydraulically actuated Quadruped (HyQ) robot, and we compared it against the state of the art WBC. We demonstrated the capabilities of STANCE with multiple terrains of different compliances, aggressive maneuvers, different forward velocities, and external disturbances. STANCE allowed HyQ to adapt online to terrains with different compliances (rigid and soft) without pre-tuning. HyQ was able to successfully deal with the transition between different terrains and showed the ability to differentiate between compliances under each foot.},

A simple criterion to evaluate if a convex set in state space is a robust control invariant set for a nonlinear uncertain system is presented. The criterion is employed to design an algorithm for computing a polytopic robust control invariant set. The method is based on the properties of DC functions, i.e. functions which can be expressed as the difference of two convex functions. Since the elements of a wide class of nonlinear functions have DC representation or, at least, admit an arbitrarily close approximation, the method is quite general.

abstract = {The simulation of multi-body systems with frictional contacts is a fundamental tool for many fields, such as robotics, computer graphics, and mechanics. Hard frictional contacts are particularly troublesome to simulate because they make the differential equations stiff, calling for computationally demanding implicit integration schemes. We suggest to tackle this issue by using exponential integrators, a long-standing class of integration schemes (first introduced in the 60's) that in recent years has enjoyed a resurgence of interest. We show that this scheme can be easily applied to multi-body systems subject to stiff viscoelastic contacts, producing accurate results at lower computational cost than classic explicit schemes. In our tests with quadruped and biped robots, our method demonstrated stable behaviors with large time steps (10 ms) and stiff contacts ($10^5$ N/m). Its excellent properties, especially for fast and coarse simulations, make it a valuable candidate for many applications in robotics, such as simulation, Model Predictive Control, Reinforcement Learning, and controller design.},

abstract = {We introduce an approximate model for predicting the net contact wrench between nominally rigid objects for use in simulation, control, and state estimation. The model combines and generalizes two ideas: a bed of springs (an "elastic foundation") and hydrostatic pressure. In this model, continuous pressure fields are computed offline for the interior of each nominally rigid object. Unlike hydrostatics or elastic foundations, the pressure fields need not satisfy mechanical equilibrium conditions. When two objects nominally overlap, a contact surface is defined where the two pressure fields are equal. This static pressure is supplemented with a dissipative rate-dependent pressure and friction to determine tractions on the contact surface. The contact wrench between pairs of objects is an integral of traction contributions over this surface. The model evaluates much faster than elasticity-theory models, while showing the essential trends of force, moment, and stiffness increase with contact load. It yields continuous wrenches even for non-convex objects and coarse meshes. The method shows promise as sufficiently fast, accurate, and robust for design-in-simulation of robot controllers.},

@article{Balkcom2016,
abstract = {The contribution of this paper is the expansion of the range of possibilities in the analysis, planning, and control of contact tasks. The successful execution of any contact task fundamentally requires the application of wrenches (forces and moments) consistent with the task. We develop an algorithm for computing the entire set of external wrenches consistent with achieving a given augmented contact mode (e.g., sliding at contact 1, rolling at contact 2, and approaching potential contact 3) for one fixed and one moving part in the plane. Unfortunately, because of the problem of frictional indeterminacy, it is usually not enough to determine the set of wrenches consistent with achieving a contact mode. Some of the computed wrenches may also be consistent with other undesirable contact modes. However, set operations on the cones returned by our algorithm can be designed to find the wrenches consistent only with desired contact modes. In this paper we also present some applications of the algorithm to analysis and planning problems. We show how to use set operations to compute the set of external wrenches with respect to which a fixtured part is `strongly stable'. If the applied external wrench is in this set, the part is guaranteed not to move. We also show how the algorithm may be used to create sensorless plans that guarantee that a workpiece will be correctly inserted into a fixture.},

However, many of the applications for which ADP offers great potential, are also safety-critical and need to meet safety specifications in the presence of physical constraints. In this article, an optimal controller for solving discrete-time nonlinear systems with state constraints is proposed. By introducing the control barrier function into the utility function, the problem with state constraints is transformed into an unconstrained optimal control problem, addressing state constraints which are difficult to handle by traditional ADP methods. The constructed sequence of value function is shown to be monotonically non-increasing and converges to the optimal value. Besides, this article gives the stability proof of the developed algorithm, as well as the conditions for satisfying the state constraints. To implement and approximate the control barrier function based adaptive dynamic programming algorithm, an actor-critic network structure is built. During the training process, two neural networks are used for approximation separately. The performance of the proposed method is validated by testing it on a simulation example.},

abstract = {Using reinforcement learning to learn control policies is a challenge when the task is complex with potentially long horizons. Ensuring adequate but safe exploration is also crucial for controlling physical systems. In this paper, we use temporal logic to facilitate specification and learning of complex tasks. We combine temporal logic with control Lyapunov functions to improve exploration. We incorporate control barrier functions to safeguard the exploration and deployment process. We develop a flexible and learnable system that allows users to specify task objectives and constraints in different forms and at various levels. The framework is also able to take advantage of known system dynamics and handle unknown environmental dynamics by integrating model-free learning with model-based planning.},

abstract = {Human-like bipedal walking is a goal of humanoid robotics. It is especially important to provide a robust falling prevention capability by imitating the human ability to switch between control strategies in response to disturbances, e.g., standing balancing and stepping motion. However, the motion control of a humanoid robot is challenging because the contact forces are constrained. This paper proposes a novel framework for control strategy switching based on the maximal output admissible (MOA) set, which is a set of initial states that satisfy the constraints. This makes it possible to determine whether the robot might fall down due to a constraint violation. The MOA set is extended to a trajectory tracking controller with a time-variant reference and constraint. In this extension, the motion of the vertical center of gravity is also considered, which has often been neglected in previous studies. Utilizing the MOA set, an example is shown of the falling prevention control by switching the standing balance control and trajectory tracking control to a stepping and hopping motion. Moreover, a method is presented for applying the MOA set framework to a position-controlled humanoid robot. The validity of the MOA set framework is verified based on simulations and experimental results.},

abstract = {Exponential integrators have enjoyed a resurgence of interest in recent years, but there is still limited understanding of how their performance compares with that of state-of-the-art integrators, most notably the commonly used Newton-Krylov implicit methods. In this paper we present comparative performance analysis of Krylov-based exponential, implicit and explicit integrators on a suite of stiff test problems and demonstrate that exponential integrators have computational advantages compared to the other methods, particularly as problems become larger and more stiff. We argue that the faster convergence of the Krylov iteration within exponential integrators accounts for the main proportion of the computational savings that they provide and illustrate how the structure of these methods ensures such efficiency. In addition, we demonstrate the computational advantages of the newly introduced Tokman and Loffeld (2010) [17] exponential propagation Runge-Kutta (EpiRK) fifth-order methods. The detailed analysis of the performance of the methods that is presented provides guidelines for the construction and implementation of efficient exponential methods and the quantitative comparisons inform the selection of appropriate schemes for other problems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, MIT Press Journals. All rights reserved. Task-Space Inverse Dynamics (TSID) is a well-known optimization-based technique for the control of highly-redundant mechanical systems, such as humanoid robots. One of its main flaws is that it does not take into account any of the uncertainties affecting these systems: poor torque tracking, sensor noises, delays and model uncertainties. As a consequence, the resulting control trajectories may be feasible for the ideal system, but not for the real one. We propose to improve the robustness of TSID by modeling uncertainties in the joint torques as additive white random noise (similarly to LQG). This results in a stochastic optimization problem, in which we can maximize the probability to satisfy the inequality constraints (i.e. to be feasible). Since computing this probability is computationally expensive, we propose three ways to approximate it that are much faster to compute and that we can then use for online control (resolution time below 1 ms). Simulation results show that taking robustness into account greatly increases the chances to have feasible control trajectories (even when the uncertainties affecting the system are not the one modeled in the controller).},

Respecting the dynamics of general multibody systems, we propose a measurement-based compensation of multi-body effects, which leads to a stable closed-loop dynamics of bipedal walking robots. In addition we propose a ZMP projection method, which prevents the robots feet from tilting and ensures the best feasible CP tracking. The extended CP controller's performance is validated in OpenHRP3 [2] simulations and compared to the controller proposed in [1].},

This framework is used to develop a CLF based receding horizon scheme, of which a special case provides an appropriate extension of Sontag's formula. The scheme is first presented as an idealized continuous-time receding horizon control law. The issue of implementation under discrete-time sampling is then discussed as a modification. These schemes are shown to possess a number of desirable theoretical and implementation properties. An example is provided, demonstrating their application to a nonlinear control problem. Finally, stronger connections to both optimal and pointwise min-norm control are proved in the Appendix under more restrictive technical conditions. {\textcopyright} 2000 IEEE.},

abstract = {With the recent surge of interest in using robotics and automation for civil purposes, providing safety and performance guarantees has become extremely important. In the past, differential games have been successfully used for the analysis of safety-critical systems. In particular, the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) formulation of differential games provides a flexible way to compute the reachable set, which can characterize the set of states which lead to either desirable or undesirable configurations, depending on the application. While HJ reachability is applicable to many small practical systems, the curse of dimensionality prevents the direct application of HJ reachability to many larger systems. To address computation complexity issues, various efficient computation methods in the literature have been developed for approximating or exactly computing the solution to HJ partial differential equations, but only when the system dynamics are of specific forms. In this paper, we propose a flexible method to trade off optimality with computation complexity in HJ reachability analysis. To achieve this, we propose to simplify system dynamics by treating state variables as disturbances. We prove that the resulting approximation is conservative in the desired direction, and demonstrate our method using a four-dimensional plane model.},

abstract = {We develop a general control framework where a low-level optimizer is built into the robot dynamics. This optimizer together with the robot constitute a goal directed dynamical system, controlled on a higher level. The high level command is a cost function. It can encode desired accelerations, end-effector poses, center of pressure, and other intuitive features that have been studied before. Unlike the currently popular quadratic programming framework, which comes with performance guarantees at the expense of modeling flexibility, the optimization problem we solve at each time step is non-convex and non-smooth. Nevertheless, by exploiting the unique properties of the soft-constraint physics model we have recently developed, we are able to design an efficient solver for goal directed dynamics. It is only two times slower than the forward dynamics solver, and is much faster than real time. The simulation results reveal that complex movements can be generated via greedy optimization of simple costs. This new computational infrastructure can facilitate teleoperation, feature-based control, deep learning of control policies, and trajectory optimization. It will become a standard feature in future releases of the MuJoCo simulator.},

abstract = {The design of legged robots is often inspired by animals evolved to excel at different tasks. However, while mimicking morphological features seen in nature can be very powerful, robots may need to perform motor tasks that their living counterparts do not. In the absence of designs that can be mimicked, an alternative is to resort to mathematical models that allow the relationship between a robot's form and function to be explored. In this paper, we propose such a model to co-design the motion and leg configurations of a robot such that a measure of performance is optimized. The framework begins by planning trajectories for a simplified model consisting of the center of mass and feet. The framework then optimizes the length of each leg link while solving for associated full-body motions. Our model was successfully used to find optimized designs for legged robots performing tasks that include jumping, walking, and climbing up a step. Although our results are preliminary and our analysis makes a number of simplifying assumptions, our findings indicate that the cost function, the sum of squared joint torques over the duration of a task, varies substantially as the design parameters change.},

abstract = {Multiped locomotion in cluttered environments is addressed as the problem of planning acyclic sequences of contacts, that characterize the motion. In order to overcome the inherent combinatorial difficulty of this problem, we separate it in two subproblems: first, planning a guide trajectory for the root of the robot and then, generating relevant contacts along this trajectory. This paper proposes theoretical contributions to these two subproblems. We propose a theoretical characterization of the guide trajectory, named “true feasibility”, which guarantees that a guide can be mapped into the contact manifold of the robot. As opposed to previous approaches, this property makes it possible to assert the relevance of a guide trajectory without explicitly computing contact configurations. Indeed, this property is efficiently checked using a low dimensional sampling-based planner (e.g. we implemented a visibility PRM). Since the guide trajectories that we characterize are easily mapped into a valid sequence of contacts, we then focus on how to select a particular sequence with desirable properties, such as robustness, efficiency and naturalness, only considered in cyclic locomotion so far. Based on these novel theoretical developments, we implement a complete acyclic contact planner and demonstrate its efficiency by producing a large variety of motions with three very different robots (humanoid, insectoid, dexterous hand) in five challenging scenarios. The quality of the obtained motions and the performance of the algorithm make it the first acyclic contact planner suitable for interactive applications.},

abstract = {Step adjustment can improve the gait robustness of biped robots; however, the adaptation of step timing is often neglected as it gives rise to nonconvex problems when optimized over several footsteps. In this article, we argue that it is not necessary to optimize walking over several steps to ensure gait viability and show that it is sufficient to merely select the next step timing and location. Using this insight, we propose a novel walking pattern generator that optimally selects step location and timing at every control cycle. Our approach is computationally simple compared to standard approaches in the literature, yet guarantees that any viable state will remain viable in the future. We propose a swing foot adaptation strategy and integrate the pattern generator with an inverse dynamics controller that does not explicitly control the center of mass nor the foot center of pressure. This is particularly useful for biped robots with limited control authority over their foot center of pressure, such as robots with point feet or passive ankles. Extensive simulations on a humanoid robot with passive ankles demonstrate the capabilities of the approach in various walking situations, including external pushes and foot slippage, and emphasize the importance of step timing adaptation to stabilize walking.},

abstract = {Abstract This report presents a novel orientation filter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The filter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The benefits of the filter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each filter update, (2) effective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters defined by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the filter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; < 0.6◦ static RMS error, < 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

@article{Schulman2016a,
abstract = {Policy gradient methods are an appealing approach in reinforcement learning because they directly optimize the cumulative reward and can straightforwardly be used with nonlinear function approximators such as neural networks. The two main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the difficulty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of the advantage function that is analogous to TD($\lambda$). We address the second challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and the value function, which are represented by neural networks. Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D locomotion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated robots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting out lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses hand-crafted policy representations, our neural network policies map directly from raw kinematics to joint torques. Our algorithm is fully model-free, and the amount of simulated experience required for the learning tasks on 3D bipeds corresponds to 1-2 weeks of real time.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider the construction, analysis, implementation and application of exponential integrators. The focus will be on two types of stiff problems. The first one is characterized by a Jacobian that possesses eigenvalues with large negative real parts. Parabolic partial differential equations and their spatial discretization are typical examples. The second class consists of highly oscillatory problems with purely imaginary eigenvalues of large modulus. Apart from motivating the construction of exponential integrators for various classes of problems, our main intention in this article is to present the mathematics behind these methods. We will derive error bounds that are independent of stiffness or highest frequencies in the system. Since the implementation of exponential integrators requires the evaluation of the product of a matrix function with a vector, we will briefly discuss some possible approaches as well. The paper concludes with some applications, in which exponential integrators are used. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Autonomous systems like aircraft and assistive robots often operate in scenarios where guaranteeing safety is critical. Methods like Hamilton-Jacobi reachability can provide guaranteed safe sets and controllers for such systems. However, often these same scenarios have unknown or uncertain environments, system dynamics, or predictions of other agents. As the system is operating, it may learn new knowledge about these uncertainties and should therefore update its safety analysis accordingly. However, work to learn and update safety analysis is limited to small systems of about two dimensions due to the computational complexity of the analysis. In this paper we synthesize several techniques to speed up computation: decomposition, warm-starting, and adaptive grids. Using this new framework we can update safe sets by one or more orders of magnitude faster than prior work, making this technique practical for many realistic systems. We demonstrate our results on simulated 2D and 10D near-hover quadcopters operating in a windy environment.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a method to improve the accuracy of trajectory optimization for dynamic robots with intermittent contact by using orthogonal collocation. Until recently, most trajectory optimization methods for systems with contacts employ mode-scheduling, which requires an a priori knowledge of the contact order and thus cannot produce complex or non-intuitive behaviors. Contact-implicit trajectory optimization methods offer a solution to this by allowing the optimization to make or break contacts as needed, but thus far have suffered from poor accuracy. Here, we combine methods from direct collocation using higher order orthogonal polynomials with contact-implicit optimization to generate trajectories with significantly improved accuracy. The key insight is to increase the order of the polynomial representation while maintaining the assumption that impact occurs over the duration of one finite element.},

abstract = {—We present a novel computational approach to optimizing the morphological design of robots. Our framework takes as input a parameterized robot design and a motion plan consisting of trajectories for end-effectors, as well as optionally, for its body. The algorithm we propose is used to optimize design parameters, namely link lengths and the placement of actuators, while concurrently adjusting motion parameters such as joint trajectories, actuator inputs, and contact forces. Our key insight is that the complex relationship between design and motion parameters can be established via sensitivity analysis if the robot's movements are modeled as spatio-temporal solutions to optimal control problems. This relationship between form and function allows us to automatically optimize robot designs based on specifications expressed as a function of range of motion or actuator forces. We evaluate our model by computationally optimizing two simulated robots that employ linear actuators: a manipulator and a large quadruped. We further validate our framework by optimizing the design of a small quadrupedal robot and testing its performance using a hardware implementation.},

abstract = {Off-line robot dynamic identification methods are mostly based on the use of the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model (IDIM), which calculates the joint force/torque that is linear in relation to the dynamic parameters, and on the use of linear least squares technique to calculate the parameters (IDIM-LS technique). The joint forces/torques are calculated as the product of the known control signal (the current reference) by the joint drive gains. Then it is essential to get accurate values of joint drive gains to get accurate identification of inertial parameters. In this paper it is proposed a new method for the identification of the total joint drive gains in one step, using available joint sampled data given by the standard controller of the moving robot and using CAD or measured values of the inertial parameters of a known payload. A new inverse dynamic model calculates the current reference signal of each joint j that is linear in relation to the dynamic parameters of the robot, to the inertial parameters of a known payload fixed to the end-effector, and to the inverse of the joint j drive gain. This model is calculated with current reference and position sampled data while the robot is tracking one reference trajectory without load on the robot and one trajectory with the known payload fixed on the robot. Each joint j drive gain is calculated independently by the weighted LS solution of an over-determined linear systems obtained with the equations of the joint j. The method is experimentally validated on an industrial St&#x00E4;ubli RX-90 robot.},

@article{Zaman2011,
abstract = {This paper proposes formulations and algorithms for design optimization under both aleatory (i.e., natural or physical variability) and epistemic uncertainty (i.e., imprecise probabilistic information), from the perspective of system robustness. The proposed formulations deal with epistemic uncertainty arising from both sparse and interval data without any assumption about the probability distributions of the random variables. A decoupled approach is proposed in this paper to un-nest the robustness-based design from the analysis of non-design epistemic variables to achieve computational efficiency. The proposed methods are illustrated for the upper stage design problem of a two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) vehicle, where the information on the random design inputs are only available as sparse point data and/or interval data. As collecting more data reduces uncertainty but increases cost, the effect of sample size on the optimality and robustness of the solution is also studied. A method is developed to determine the optimal sample size for sparse point data that leads to the solutions of the design problem that are least sensitive to variations in the input random variables.},

abstract = {We present IS-MPC, an intrinsically stable MPC framework for humanoid gait generation which incorporates an explicit stability constraint in the formulation. The proposed method uses as prediction model a dynamically extended LIP where ZMP velocities are the control inputs, producing in real time a gait (including footsteps with the associated timing) that realizes omnidirectional motion commands coming from an external source. The stability constraint links the future ZMP velocities to the current system state so as to guarantee the essential requirement that the generated CoM trajectory is bounded with respect to the ZMP trajectory. Since the control horizon of the MPC algorithm is finite, only part of the future ZMP velocities are decision variables of the QP problem; the remaining part, called tail, must be either conjectured or anticipated using preview information on the reference motion. Several possible options for the tail are discussed, and each of them is shown to correspond to a specific terminal constraint. A theoretical analysis of the feasibility of the generic MPC iteration is developed and used to obtain sufficient conditions for recursive feasibility. Finally, it is proved that IS-MPC guarantees stability of the CoM/ZMP dynamics if it is recursively feasible. Simulation and experimental results on the NAO and the HRP-4 humanoids are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.},

We demonstrate both the power and efficiency of our planner using the problem of hitting a nail with a hammer, which requires the robot to reach a given goal velocity while avoiding obstacles. Our planner is able to solve this problem in less than 100 ms. In contrast, a purely geometric planner is unable to hit the nail at the desired velocity, whereas a standard kinodynamic RRT is multiple orders of magnitude slower.},

In this work, we describe the Reanalyse algorithm which uses model-based policy and value improvement operators to compute new improved training targets on existing data points, allowing efficient learning for data budgets varying by several orders of magnitude. We further show that Reanalyse can also be used to learn entirely from demonstrations without any environment interactions, as in the case of offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL). Combining Reanalyse with the MuZero algorithm, we introduce MuZero Unplugged, a single unified algorithm for any data budget, including offline RL. In contrast to previous work, our algorithm does not require any special adaptations for the off-policy or offline RL settings. MuZero Unplugged sets new state-of-the-art results in the RL Unplugged offline RL benchmark as well as in the online RL benchmark of Atari in the standard 200 million frame setting.},

abstract = {This paper considers the stability of an object supported by several frictionless contacts in a potential field such as gravity. The bodies supporting the object induce a partition of the object's configuration space into strata corresponding to different contact arrangements. Stance stability becomes a geometric problem of determining whether the object's configuration is a local minimum of its potential energy function on the stratified configuration space. We use stratified Morse theory to develop a generic stance stability test that has the following characteristics. For a small number of contacts - less than three in 2D and less than six in 3D - stance stability depends both on surface normals and surface curvature at the contacts. Moreover, lower curvature at the contacts leads to better stability. For a larger number of contacts, stance stability depends only on surface normals at the contacts. The stance stability test is applied to quasi-static locomotion planning in two dimensions. The region of stable center-of-mass positions associated with a <i>k</i>-contact stance is characterized. Then, a quasi-static locomotion scheme for a three-legged robot over a piecewise linear terrain is described. Finally, friction is shown to provide robustness and enhanced stability for the frictionless locomotion plan. A full maneuver simulation illustrates the locomotion scheme.},

The proposed method transforms a pure-state equality constraint into a mixed state-control constraint such that the constraint is expressed by variables at a certain previous time stage. It is showed that if the solution satisfies the second-order sufficient conditions of the OCP with the transformed mixed state-control constraints, it is a local minimum of the OCP with the original pure-state constraints. A Riccati recursion algorithm is derived to solve the OCP using the transformed constraints with linear time complexity in the grid number of the horizon, in contrast to a previous approach that scales cubically with respect to the total dimension of the pure-state equality constraints. Numerical experiments on the whole-body optimal control of quadrupedal gaits that involve pure-state equality constraints owing to contact switches demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing approaches.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, quadrotors have become increasingly popular amongst researchers and hobbyist. Although tremendous progress has been made towards making drones autonomous, advanced capabilities, such as aggressive maneuvering and visual perception, are still confined to either laboratory environments with motion capture systems or drone platforms with large size, weight, and power requirements. We identify two recent developments that may help address these shortcomings. On the one hand, new embedded high-performance computers equipped with powerful Graphics Processor Units (GPUs). These computers enable real-time onboard processing of vision data. On the other hand, recently introduced compressed continuous computation techniques for stochastic optimal control allow designing feedback control systems for agile maneuvering. In this thesis, we design, implement and demonstrate a micro unmanned aerial vehicle capable of executing certain agile maneuvers using only a forward-facing camera and an inertial measurement unit. Specifically, we develop a hardware platform equipped with an Nvidia Jetson embedded super-computer for vision processing. We develop a low-latency software suite, including onboard visual marker detection, visual-inertial estimation and control algorithms. The fullstate estimation is set up with respect to a visual target, such as a window. A nonlinear globally-optimal controller is designed to execute the desired flight maneuver. The resulting optimization problem is solved using tensor-train-decomposition-based compressed continuous computation techniques. The platform's capabilities and the potential of these types of controllers are demonstrated in both simulation studies and in experiments.},

abstract = {We propose a reactive controller framework for robust quadrupedal locomotion, designed to cope with terrain irregularities, trajectory tracking errors and poor state estimation. The framework comprises two main modules: One related to the generation of elliptic trajectories for the feet and the other for control of the stability of the whole robot. We propose a task space CPG-based trajectory generation that can be modulated according to terrain irregularities and the posture of the robot trunk. To improve the robot's stability, we implemented a null space based attitude control for the trunk and a push recovery algorithm based on the concept of capture points. Simulations and experimental results on the hydraulically actuated quadruped robot HyQ will be presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.},

The LC-RCI set, assumed to be symmetric around the origin and described by the same number of affine inequalities as twice the dimension of the state vector, is the result of an iterative procedure, where semi-definite programs (SDPs) are solved at each step. The SDPs are formulated to increase the LC-RCI volume at each step, subject to tractable reformulations of the system constraints as well as the invariance condition (in the form of standard or dilated LMIs), and a new approach to determinant maximization. The two proposed algorithms are applicable to systems with rational parameter dependence, which cannot be handled with the existing similar approaches without introducing additional conservatism.},

Although these devices have immense potential to improve welfare, their persistent presence may come at a cognitive cost. In this research, we test the “brain drain” hypothesis that the mere presence of one's own smartphone may occupy limited-capacity cognitive resources, thereby leaving fewer resources available for other tasks and undercutting cognitive performance. Results from two experiments indicate that even when people are successful at maintaining sustained attention—as when avoiding the temptation to check their phones—the mere presence of these devices reduces available cognitive capacity. Moreover, these cognitive costs are highest for those highest in smartphone dependence. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of this smartphone-induced brain drain for consumer decision-making and consumer welfare.},

Based on eCMP, VRP, and DCM, we present methods for real-time planning and tracking control of DCM trajectories in 3-D. The basic DCM trajectory generator is extended to produce continuous leg force profiles and to facilitate the use of toe-off motion during double support. The robustness of the proposed control framework is thoroughly examined, and its capabilities are verified both in simulations and experiments.},

@article{Sun2018,
abstract = {This paper presents an efficient optimization framework that solves trajectory optimization problems efficiently by decoupling state variables from timing variables, thereby decomposing a challenging nonlinear programming (NLP) problem into two easier subproblems. With timing fixed, the state variables can be optimized efficiently using convex optimization, and so the time variables can be optimized using a separate outer optimization. This is a bilevel optimization in which the outer objective function itself requires an optimization to compute. The challenge is that gradient optimization methods require the gradient of the objective function with respect to the time variables, which is not available. Whereas the finite difference method must solve many optimization problems to compute a gradient, this paper proposes a more efficient method: the dual solution (Lagrange multipliers) of the convex optimization problem is exploited to calculate the analytical gradient. Since the dual solution is a by-product of the convex optimization problem, the gradient can be obtained `for free' with high accuracy. The framework is demonstrated on solving minimum-jerk trajectory optimization problems in safety corridors for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Experiments demonstrate that bilevel optimization improves performance over a standard NLP solver, and analytical gradients outperforms finite differences. With a 40\,ms cutoff time, our approach achieves over 8 times better suboptimality than the current state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Global food production is identified as a great threat to the environment. In combination with technical advances in agriculture, dietary change is suggested to be necessary to reduce the environmental impact of the food system. In this article a systematic review assessing the environmental impact of dietary change is performed. The aims are to i) evaluate the scientific basis of dietary scenario analysis, ii) estimate the potential environmental effects of dietary change, iii) identify methodological aspects of importance for outcome and iv) identify current gaps in knowledge. The review includes 14 peer-reviewed journal articles assessing the GHG emissions and land use demand of in total 49 dietary scenarios. The results suggest that dietary change, in areas with affluent diet, could play an important role in reaching environmental goals, with up to 50% potential to reduce GHG emissions and land use demand associated with the current diet. The choice of functional unit, system boundaries and methods for scenario development and accounting for uncertainties are methodological aspects identified to have major influence on the quality and results of dietary scenario analysis. Further understanding of dietary change as a measure for more sustainable food systems requires improved knowledge of uncertainty in dietary scenario studies, environmental impact from substitutes and complements to meat and the effect of dietary change in different groups of populations and geographical locations.},

In contrast to most previous methods, we do not pre-specify contact switches, timings, points or gait patterns, but they are a direct outcome of the optimization. Furthermore, we optimize over the entire dynamics of the robot, which enables the optimizer to fully leverage the capabilities of the robot. To illustrate the spectrum of achievable motions, here we show eight different tasks, which would require very different control structures when solved with state-of-the-art methods. Using our trajectory Optimization approach, we are solving each task with a simple, high level cost function and without any changes in the control structure. Furthermore, we fully integrated our approach with the robot's control and estimation framework such that optimization can be run online. By demonstrating a rough manipulation task with multiple dynamic contact switches, we exemplarily show how optimized trajectories and control inputs can be directly applied to hardware.},

abstract = {Models are among the most essential tools in robotics, such as kinematics and dynamics models of the robot's own body and controllable external objects. It is widely believed that intelligent mammals also rely on internal models in order to generate their actions. However, while classical robotics relies on manually generated models that are based on human insights into physics, future autonomous, cognitive robots need to be able to automatically generate models that are based on information which is extracted from the data streams accessible to the robot. In this paper, we survey the progress in model learning with a strong focus on robot control on a kinematic as well as dynamical level. Here, a model describes essential information about the behavior of the environment and the influence of an agent on this environment. In the context of model-based learning control, we view the model from three different perspectives. First, we need to study the different possible model learning architectures for robotics. Second, we discuss what kind of problems these architecture and the domain of robotics imply for the applicable learning methods. From this discussion, we deduce future directions of real-time learning algorithms. Third, we show where these scenarios have been used successfully in several case studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Marta Olivetti Belardinelli and Springer-Verlag.},

The data required for training is solely from proprioceptive sensors - endeffector contact wrench sensors and inertial measurement units (IMUs) - and the method is completely unsupervised. The resulting cluster means are used to efficiently compute the probability of contact in each of the six endeffector degrees of freedom (DoFs) independently. This clustering-based contact probability estimator is validated in a kinematics-based base state estimator in a simulation environment with realistic added sensor noise for locomotion over rough, low-friction terrain on which the robot is subject to foot slip and rotation. The proposed base state estimator which utilizes these six DoF contact probability estimates is shown to perform considerably better than that which determines kinematic contact constraints purely based on measured normal force.},

abstract = {While neural networks have achieved high accuracy on standard image classification benchmarks, their accuracy drops to nearly zero in the presence of small adversarial perturbations to test inputs. Defenses based on regularization and adversarial training have been proposed, but often followed by new, stronger attacks that defeat these defenses. Can we somehow end this arms race? In this work, we study this problem for neural networks with one hidden layer. We first propose a method based on a semidefinite relaxation that outputs a certificate that for a given network and test input, no attack can force the error to exceed a certain value. Second, as this certificate is differentiable, we jointly optimize it with the network parameters, providing an adaptive regularizer that encourages robustness against all attacks. On MNIST, our approach produces a network and a certificate that no attack that perturbs each pixel by at most = 0.1 can cause more than 35% test error.},

abstract = {Despite the great empirical success of deep reinforcement learning, its theoretical foundation is less well understood. In this work, we make the first attempt to theoretically understand the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm (Mnih et al., 2015) from both algorithmic and statistical perspectives. In specific, we focus on a slight simplification of DQN that fully captures its key features. Under mild assumptions, we establish the algorithmic and statistical rates of convergence for the action-value functions of the iterative policy sequence obtained by DQN. In particular, the statistical error characterizes the bias and variance that arise from approximating the action-value function using deep neural network, while the algorithmic error converges to zero at a geometric rate. As a byproduct, our analysis provides justifications for the techniques of experience replay and target network, which are crucial to the empirical success of DQN. Furthermore, as a simple extension of DQN, we propose the Minimax-DQN algorithm for zero-sum Markov game with two players. Borrowing the analysis of DQN, we also quantify the difference between the policies obtained by Minimax-DQN and the Nash equilibrium of the Markov game in terms of both the algorithmic and statistical rates of convergence.},

abstract = {The quality of the visual feedback can vary significantly on a legged robot that is meant to traverse unknown and unstructured terrains. The map of the environment, acquired with online state-of-the-art algorithms, often degrades after a few steps, due to sensing inaccuracies, slippage and unexpected disturbances. When designing locomotion algorithms, this degradation can result in planned trajectories that are not consistent with the reality, if not dealt properly. In this work, we propose a heuristic-based planning approach that enables a quadruped robot to successfully traverse a significantly rough terrain (e.g., stones up to 10 cm of diameter), in absence of visual feedback. When available, the approach allows also to exploit the visual feedback (e.g., to enhance the stepping strategy) in multiple ways, according to the quality of the 3D map. The proposed framework also includes reflexes, triggered in specific situations, and the possibility to estimate online an unknown time-varying disturbance and compensate for it. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with experiments performed on our quadruped robot HyQ (85 kg), traversing different terrains, such as: ramps, rocks, bricks, pallets and stairs. We also demonstrate the capability to estimate and compensate for disturbances, showing the robot walking up a ramp while pulling a cart attached to its back.},

abstract = {Legged vehicles offer several advantages over wheeled vehicles, particularly over broken terrain, but are presently too slow to be advantageous for many tasks. Trotting, the precursor to galloping for many quadrupeds, employs high-speed actuation to coordinate the intermittent ground contacts for each leg. Compliant elements and high-power actuators combine to perform a complex interchange of potential and kinetic energy during these short thrust intervals. These complexities, the frictional and contact losses that occur during normal running, plus the high number of degrees of freedom make three-dimensional (3D) dynamic quadruped motion very difficult to model accurately for control. For this reason, most of the research effort has been focused on simplified planar systems, only allowing motion in the sagittal plane. Many of these controllers only perform well around a fixed operating point and cannot regulate heading for desired changes in running direction. A 3D trotting controller which overcomes the above problems is presented here. Simulation results show the system responding appropriately to changes in the desired speed up to 3 m/s and heading up to 20 deg/s. },

abstract = {We consider the problem of computing viability sets for nonlinear continuous systems. Our main goal is to deal with the "curse of dimensionality", the exponential growth of the computation in the dimension of the state space. The viability problem is formulated as an optimal control problem whose value function is known to be a viscosity solution to a particular type of Hamilton Jacob! partial differential equation. We propose a trial solution based on a Feed-Forward Neural Network for the Hamilton Jacobi equation with the given boundary conditions. We use random extractions from the state space to generate training points and then employ the r-algorithm for non smooth optimization to train the network. We illustrate the method on a 2 dimensional example from aerodynamic envelope protection. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {We study the problem of safe learning and exploration in sequential control problems. The goal is to safely collect data samples from operating in an environment, in order to learn to achieve a challenging control goal (e.g., an agile maneuver close to a boundary). A central challenge in this setting is how to quantify uncertainty in order to choose provably-safe actions that allow us to collect informative data and reduce uncertainty, thereby achieving both improved controller safety and optimality. To address this challenge, we present a deep robust regression model that is trained to directly predict the uncertainty bounds for safe exploration. We derive generalization bounds for learning, and connect them with safety and stability bounds in control. We demonstrate empirically that our robust regression approach can outperform the conventional Gaussian process (GP) based safe exploration in settings where it is difficult to specify a good GP prior.},

One of our key observations is that the Taylor-expansion, central to DDP, can be reformulated in terms of second-order statistics computed of the sampled trajectories. SaDDP makes few assumptions about the controlled system and works with black-box dynamics simulations with non-smooth contacts.

Although such a behavior is quite natural for humans, it is very difficult to find the best formulation to adapt human motion to humanoid robots. This paper proposes a conceptually simple framework of human posture control based on optimization which takes into account grasp and friction and achieves robustness against external disturbances. A new stability criteria is also introduced. Contrary to most other approaches, our method deals not only with unilateral contacts with friction but also with bilateral grasps. This allows for arbitrarily pulling, pushing or twisting on a handhold. Additionally, and in contrast to classical methods based on ZMP, our method also accounts for contacts not being all in the same plane.},

This problem arises with the adoption of tactile systems with a large number of sensors, and it is particularly critical in those cases in which the system is made of flexible material that is deployed on a curved surface. In this scenario the location of each taxel is partially unknown and difficult to determine manually. Placing the device is in fact an inaccurate procedure that is affected by displacements in both position and orientation. Our approach is based on the idea that it is possible to automatically infer the position of the taxels by measuring the interaction forces exchanged between the sensorized part and the environment. The location of the contact is estimated through force/torque (F/T) measures gathered by a sensor mounted on the kinematic chain of the robot. Our method requires few hypotheses and can be effectively implemented on a real platform, as demonstrated by the experiments with the iCub humanoid robot. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {Ensuring control performance with state and input constraints is facilitated by the understanding of reachable and invariant sets. While exploiting dynamical models have provided many set-based algorithms for constructing these sets, set-based methods typically do not scale well, or rely heavily on model accuracy or structure. In contrast, it is relatively simple to generate state trajectories in a data-driven manner by numerically simulating complex systems from initial conditions sampled from within an admissible state space, even if the underlying dynamics are completely unknown. These samples can then be leveraged for reachable/invariant set estimation via machine learning, although the learning performance is strongly linked to the sampling pattern. In this paper, active learning is employed to intelligently select batches of samples that are most informative and least redundant to previously labeled samples via submodular maximization. Selective sampling reduces the number of numerical simulations required for constructing the invariant set estimator, thereby enhancing scalability to higher-dimensional state spaces. The potential of the proposed framework is illustrated via a numerical example.},

abstract = {In many real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems, besides optimizing the main objective function, an agent must concurrently avoid violating a number of constraints. In particular, besides optimizing performance, it is crucial to guarantee the safety of an agent during training as well as deployment (e.g., a robot should avoid taking actions - exploratory or not - which irrevocably harm its hardware). To incorporate safety in RL, we derive algorithms under the framework of constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs), an extension of the standard Markov decision processes (MDPs) augmented with constraints on expected cumulative costs. Our approach hinges on a novel Lyapunov method. We define and present a method for constructing Lyapunov functions, which provide an effective way to guarantee the global safety of a behavior policy during training via a set of local linear constraints. Leveraging these theoretical underpinnings, we show how to use the Lyapunov approach to systematically transform dynamic programming (DP) and RL algorithms into their safe counterparts. To illustrate their effectiveness, we evaluate these algorithms in several CMDP planning and decision-making tasks on a safety benchmark domain. Our results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing baselines in balancing constraint satisfaction and performance.},

More so than other communities, operations research continued to develop the theory behind the basic model introduced by Bellman with discrete states and actions, even while authors as early as Bellman himself recognized its limits due to the “curse of dimensionality” inherent in discrete state spaces. In response to these limitations, subcommunities in computer science, control theory and operations research have developed a variety of methods for solving different classes of stochastic, dynamic optimization problems, creating the appearance of a jungle of competing approaches. In this article, we show that there is actually a common theme to these strategies, and underpinning the entire field remains the fundamental algorithmic strategies of value and policy iteration that were first introduced in the 1950's and 60's.},

@article{Trent2013,
abstract = {Risk frames nearly every decision we make. Yet, remarkably little is known about whether risk influences how we learn new movements. Risk-sensitivity can emerge when there is a distortion between the absolute magnitude (actual value) and how much an individual values (subjective value) a given outcome. In movement, this translates to the difference between a given movement error and its consequences. Surprisingly, how movement learning can be influenced by the consequences associated with an error is not well-understood. It is traditionally assumed that all errors are created equal, i.e., that adaptation is proportional to an error experienced. However, not all movement errors of a given magnitude have the same subjective value. Here we examined whether the subjective value of error influenced how participants adapted their control from movement to movement. Seated human participants grasped the handle of a force-generating robotic arm and made horizontal reaching movements in two novel dynamic environments that penalized errors of the same magnitude differently, changing the subjective value of the errors. We expected that adaptation in response to errors of the same magnitude would differ between these environments. In the first environment, Stable, errors were not penalized. In the second environment, Unstable, rightward errors were penalized with the threat of unstable, cliff-like forces. We found that adaptation indeed differed. Specifically, in the Unstable environment, we observed reduced adaptation to leftward errors, an appropriate strategy that reduced the chance of a penalizing rightward error. These results demonstrate that adaptation is influenced by the subjective value of error, rather than solely the magnitude of error, and therefore is risk-sensitive. In other words, we may not simply learn from our mistakes, we may also learn from the value of our mistakes.},

Based on this procedure, control invariant sets can be computed by recursion. We present a method for the computation of the one-step set using interval arithmetic. The proposed specialized branch and bound algorithm provides an inner approximation with a given bound of the error; this makes it possible to achieve a trade off between accuracy of the computed set and computational burden. Furthermore an algorithm to approximate the one step set by an inner bounded polyhedron is also presented; this allows us to relax the complexity of the obtained set, and to make easier the recursion and storage of the sets. {\textcopyright} 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Notwithstanding the research on dynamic modelling of Industrial Robots (IRs hereafter) covers the last three decades, improvements are necessary to enable IRs adoption in technological tasks where high dynamics or interaction with environment is needed, e.g. deburring, milling, laser cutting etc. Indeed, this class of applications displays even more the necessity of high-accuracy tracking especially in workspace sub-regions, while common IR dynamic calibration methods often span the workspace at large (in term of positions and high velocities) resulting in an averagely fitting models. Open issues are therefore on the applicability/scalability of standard methods in workspace sub-regions and on the metrics used for the calibration performance evaluation. The paper proposes an algorithm designed to high-accuracy local dynamic identification, comparing it with the results achievable by a common IRs dynamic calibration method and by the same method scaled to a workspace sub-region. In addition, unlike from standard, the here reported experimental comparison is made by evaluating the torque prediction error for IRs robot moving along path programmed by standard/commercial IR motion planner and not along path belonging to the same template-class of trajectory used in identification phase.},

Joined to a rough reference trajectory generator (step, ramp, etc.) it provides smooth output signals according to user-selectable bounds on trajectory derivatives. The bounds on output derivatives can be changed during system operation without impairing system stability. Moreover, minimum time response with guaranteed no overshoot is ensured both in the continuous and discrete-time implementations. The main contribution of the paper lies in the discrete-time version of the trajectory generator. The performance of the proposed nonlinear filters is tested through simulation experiments.

abstract = {Deep learning has achieved astonishing results on many tasks with large amounts of data and generalization within the proximity of training data. For many important real-world applications, these requirements are unfeasible and additional prior knowledge on the task domain is required to overcome the resulting problems. In particular, learning physics models for model-based control requires robust extrapolation from fewer samples - often collected online in real-time - and model errors may lead to drastic damages of the system. Directly incorporating physical insight has enabled us to obtain a novel deep model learning approach that extrapolates well while requiring fewer samples. As a first example, we propose Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) as a deep network structure upon which Lagrangian Mechanics have been imposed. DeLaN can learn the equations of motion of a mechanical system (i.e., system dynamics) with a deep network efficiently while ensuring physical plausibility. The resulting DeLaN network performs very well at robot tracking control. The proposed method did not only outperform previous model learning approaches at learning speed but exhibits substantially improved and more robust extrapolation to novel trajectories and learns online in real-time.},

abstract = {A central problem in motor control is understanding how the many biomechanical degrees of freedom are coordinated to achieve a common goal. An especially puzzling aspect of coordination is that behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Existing theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement or the richness of motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two. Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal feedback control. We show that the optimal strategy in the face of uncertainty is to allow variability in redundant (task-irrelevant) dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a desired trajectory, but uses feedback more intelligently, correcting only those deviations that interfere with task goals. From this framework, task-constrained variability, goal-directed corrections, motor synergies, controlled parameters, simplifying rules and discrete coordination modes emerge naturally. We present experimental results from a range of motor tasks to support this theory.},

abstract = {— Maintaining balance is fundamental to legged robots. The most commonly used mechanisms for balance control are taking a step, regulating the center of pressure ('ankle strategies'), and to a lesser extent, changing centroidal angular momentum (e.g., 'hip strategies'). In this paper, we disregard these three mechanisms, instead focusing on a fourth: vary-ing center of mass height. We study a 2D variable-height center of mass model, and analyze how center of mass height variation can be used to achieve bal-ance, in the sense of convergence to a fixed point of the dynamics. In this analysis, we pay special attention to the constraint of unilateral contact forces. We first derive a necessary condition that must be satisfied to be able to achieve balance. We then present two control laws, and derive their regions of attraction in closed form. We show that one of the control laws achieves balance from any state satisfying the neces-sary condition for balance. Finally, we briefly discuss the relative importance of CoM height variation and other balance mechanisms.},

abstract = {Rigid-body dynamics with unilateral contact is a good approximation for a wide range of everyday phenomena, from the operation of car brakes to walking to rock slides. It is also of vital importance for simulating robots, virtual reality, and realistic animation. However, correctly modeling rigid-body dynamics with friction is difficult due to a number of discontinuities in the behavior of rigid bodies and the discontinuities inherent in the Coulomb friction law. This is particularly crucial for handling situations with large coefficients of friction, which can result in paradoxical results known at least since Painleve. This single example has been a counterexample and cause of controversy ever since, and only recently have there been rigorous mathematical results that show the existence of solutions to his example. The new mathematical developments in rigid-body dynamics have come from several sources: `sweeping processes' and the measure differential inclusions of Moreau in the 1970s and 1980s, the variational inequality approaches of Duvaut and J.-L. Lions in the 1970s, and the use of complementarity problems to formulate frictional contact problems by Lotstedt in the early 1980s. However, it wasn't until much more recently that these tools were finally able to produce rigorous results about rigid-body dynamics with Coulomb friction and impulses.},

Whilepromising results have been achieved recently, robust and reliable controllers are still a challenge for the control community. State-of-the-art balancing controllers are based on the control of the robot momentum, but the stability analysis of these controllers is still missing. The contribution of this paper is twofold. We first numerically show that the application of state-of-the-art momentum-based control strategies may lead to unstable zero dynamics. Secondly, we propose simple modifications to the control architecture that avoid instabilities at the zero-dynamics level. Asymptotic stability of the closed loop system is shown by means of a Lyapunov analysis. The theoretical results are validated with both simulations and experiments on the iCub humanoid robot.},

Our results show that the prediction error concept is sensitive to unavoidable model uncertainties. We also demonstrate empirically the fast convergence properties of least-squares adaptation relative to gradient approaches.

Some of the regions are divided, and a procedure based on sum-of-squares programming is designed to determine which of the possible solutions are in fact optimal. Finally, the online algorithm is shown to be better in terms of computational cost and memory requirements than an algorithm based on obtaining and comparing the solutions of the problem using as constraints the polyhedra whose union forms the non-convex regions, both theoretically and by the results of an example. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Making neural networks robust against adversarial inputs has resulted in an arms race between new defenses and attacks. The most promising defenses, adversarially robust training and verifiably robust training, have limitations that restrict their practical applications. The adversarially robust training only makes the networks robust against a subclass of attackers and we reveal such weaknesses by developing a new attack based on interval gradients. By contrast, verifiably robust training provides protection against any L-p norm-bounded attacker but incurs orders of magnitude more computational and memory overhead than adversarially robust training. We propose two novel techniques, stochastic robust approximation and dynamic mixed training, to drastically improve the efficiency of verifiably robust training without sacrificing verified robustness. We leverage two critical insights: (1) instead of over the entire training set, sound over-approximations over randomly subsampled training data points are sufficient for efficiently guiding the robust training process; and (2) We observe that the test accuracy and verifiable robustness often conflict after certain training epochs. Therefore, we use a dynamic loss function to adaptively balance them for each epoch. We designed and implemented our techniques as part of MixTrain and evaluated it on six networks trained on three popular datasets including MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet-200. Our evaluations show that MixTrain can achieve up to $95.2\%$ verified robust accuracy against $L_\infty$ norm-bounded attackers while taking $15$ and $3$ times less training time than state-of-the-art verifiably robust training and adversarially robust training schemes, respectively. Furthermore, MixTrain easily scales to larger networks like the one trained on ImageNet-200, significantly outperforming the existing verifiably robust training methods.},

abstract = {Recent trends pushing robots into unstructured environments with limited sensors have motivated considerable work on planning under uncertainty and stochastic optimal control, but these methods typically do not provide guaranteed performance. Here we consider the problem of bounding the probability of failure (defined as leaving a finite region of state space) over a finite time for stochastic nonlinear systems with continuous state. Our approach searches for exponential barrier functions that provide bounds using a variant of the classical supermartingale result. We provide a relaxation of this search to a semidefinite program, yielding an efficient algorithm that provides rigorous upper bounds on the probability of failure for the original nonlinear system. We give a number of numerical examples in both discrete and continuous time that demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

Our algorithm avoids complex height planning by allowing a whole-body controller to determine the straightest possible leg configuration at run-time. The controller solutions are biased towards a straight leg configuration by projecting leg joint angle objectives into the null-space of the other quadratic program motion objectives. To allow the legs to remain straight throughout the gait, toe-off was utilized to increase the kinematic reachability of the legs. The toe-off motion is achieved through underconstraining the foot position, allowing it to emerge naturally. We applied this approach of under-specifying the motion objectives to the Atlas humanoid, allowing it to walk over a variety of terrain. We present both experimental and simulation results and discuss performance limitations and potential improvements.},

In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function ("avoiding side effects" and "avoiding reward hacking"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently ("scalable supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the learning process ("safe exploration" and "distributional shift"). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},

We extend the available Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches for walking on flat terrain to plan for both vertical motion of the Center of Mass (CoM) and external contact forces consistent with a given task. The optimization problem is comprised of three stages, i. e. the CoM vertical motion, joint angles, and contact forces planning. The choice of external contact (e. g. hand contact with the object or environment) among all available locations and the appropriate time to reach and maintain a contact are all computed automatically within the algorithm. The presented algorithm benefits from the simplicity of the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM), while it overcomes the common limitations of this model and enables us to generate a variety of whole-body motions through external contacts. Simulation and experimental implementation of several whole-body actions in multi-contact scenarios on a humanoid robot show the capability of the proposed algorithm.},

Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

Sources of non-convexity may include nonlinear dynamics and non-convex state/control constraints. To tackle the challenge posed by non-convexity, first we utilize exact penalty function to handle the nonlinear dynamics. Then the proposed algorithm successively convexifies the problem via a project-and-linearize procedure. Thus a finite dimensional convex programming subproblem is solved at each succession, which can be done efficiently with fast Interior Point Method (IPM) solvers. Global convergence to a local optimum is demonstrated with certain convexity assumptions, which are satisfied in a broad range of optimal control problems. The proposed algorithm is particularly suitable for solving trajectory planning problems with collision avoidance constraints. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges reliably after only a few successions. Thus with powerful IPM based custom solvers, the algorithm can be implemented onboard for real-time autonomous control applications.},

This work provides the first demonstration of RWS-related efficiency improvements on a physical robot and identifies the energy-saving paradigm. Gaits for a five-link planar biped are generated via trajectory optimization with and without reaction wheels. Comparisons of the resulting system behavior show a 5-10% efficiency advantage for robots with an RWS under typical walking conditions and a larger advantage near regions of marginal dynamic feasibility. The savings are mainly accomplished by enabling trajectories with better joint motor utilization, not by minimizing impact losses or acting as a kinetic energy recovery system. The RWS also improves centroidal angular momentum regulation, with the reduction in centroidal angular momentum amplitude reaching 30% at high speeds. Simulations and experiments with a five-link planar biped validate the efficiency improvements seen in optimization. This demonstrates the viability of using efficient inertial actuators to improve the efficiency of complex walking robots.},

In this work, we show that the feedback policy from a Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) based MPC algorithm is a viable alternative to bridge the gap between the low MPC update rate and the actuation command rate. We propose to augment the DDP approach with a relaxed barrier function to address inequality constraints arising from the friction cone.

abstract = {— Feedback control of robotic systems interacting with the environment through contacts is a central topic in legged robotics. One of the main challenges posed by this problem is the choice of a model sufficiently complex to capture the discontinuous nature of the dynamics but simple enough to allow online computations. Linear models have proved to be the most effective and reliable choice for smooth systems; we believe that piecewise affine (PWA) models represent their natural extension when contact phenomena occur. Discrete-time PWA systems have been deeply analyzed in the field of hybrid Model Predictive Control (MPC), but the straightforward application of MPC techniques to complex systems, such as a humanoid robot, leads to mixed-integer optimization problems which are not solvable at real-time rates. Explicit MPC methods can construct the entire control policy offline, but the resulting policy becomes too complex to compute for systems at the scale of a humanoid robot. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm which splits the computational burden between an offline sampling phase and a limited number of online convex optimizations, enabling the application of hybrid predictive controllers to higher-dimensional systems. In doing so we are willing to partially sacrifice feedback optimality, but we set stability of the system as an inviolable requirement. Simulation results of a simple planar humanoid that balances by making contact with its environment are presented to validate the proposed controller.},

abstract = {Reference signals used to drive feedback control loops are often evaluated on-the-fly on the basis of the systems operating conditions. As a consequence, it is very difficult to guarantee a priori properties like continuity or the existence of bounds on the signal dynamics and, therefore, control systems performances could deteriorate. Improved answers can be obtained if input signals are properly smoothed. The paper proposes a possible filtering system which output mimics at best any given input signal, compatibly with some smoothness requirements. In particular, generated signals are continuous up to the second time derivative and their first three time derivatives are constrained between assigned bounds. Differ- ently from analogous solutions proposed in the past, it also handles asymmetric bounds.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, South China University of Technology, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. This paper considers the torque control problem for robots with flexible joints driven by electrical actuators. It is shown that the achievable closed-loop tracking bandwidth using PI torque controllers may be limited due to transmission zeros introduced by the load dynamics. This limitation is overcome by using positive feedback from the load motion in unison with PI torque controllers. The positive feedback is given in terms of load velocity, acceleration and jerk. Stability conditions for designing decentralized PI torque controllers are derived in terms of Routh-Hurwitz criteria. Disturbance rejection properties of the closed system are characterized and an analysis is carried out investigating the use of approximate positive feedback by omitting acceleration and/or jerk signals. The results of this paper are illustrated for a two DoF (degrees of freedom) system. Experimental results for a one DoF system are also included.},

abstract = {We present a general approach for controlling robotic systems that make and break contact with their environments. Contact-implicit model predictive control (CI-MPC) generalizes linear MPC to contact-rich settings by utilizing a bi-level planning formulation with lower-level contact dynamics formulated as time-varying linear complementarity problems (LCPs) computed using strategic Taylor approximations about a reference trajectory. These dynamics enable the upper-level planning problem to reason about contact timing and forces, and generate entirely new contact-mode sequences online. To achieve reliable and fast numerical convergence, we devise a structure-exploiting interior-point solver for these LCP contact dynamics and a custom trajectory optimizer for the tracking problem. We demonstrate real-time solution rates for CI-MPC and the ability to generate and track non-periodic behaviours in hardware experiments on a quadrupedal robot. We also show that the controller is robust to model mismatch and can respond to disturbances by discovering and exploiting new contact modes across a variety of robotic systems in simulation, including a pushbot, planar hopper, planar quadruped, and planar biped.},

abstract = {This paper presents the methodology used to achieve efficient and dynamic walking behaviors on the prototype humanoid robotics platform, DURUS. As a means of providing a hardware platform capable of these behaviors, the design of DURUS combines highly efficient electromechanical components with “control in the loop” design of the leg morphology. Utilizing the final design of DURUS, a formal framework for the generation of dynamic walking gaits which maximizes efficiency by exploiting the full body dynamics of the robot, including the interplay between the passive and active elements, is developed. The gaits generated through this methodology form the basis of the control implementation experimentally realized on DURUS; in particular, the trajectories generated through the formal framework yield a feedforward control input which is modulated by feedback in the form of regulators that compensate for discrepancies between the model and physical system. The end result of the unified approach to control-informed mechanical design, formal gait design and regulator-based feedback control implementation is efficient and dynamic locomotion on the humanoid robot DURUS. In particular, DURUS was able to demonstrate dynamic locomotion at the DRC Finals Endurance Test, walking for just under five hours in a single day, traveling 3.9 km with a mean cost of transport of 1.61-the lowest reported cost of transport achieved on a bipedal humanoid robot.},

abstract = {—This paper presents a new framework for the generation of high-speed running jumps to clear terrain obstacles in quadrupedal robots. Our methods enable the quadruped to autonomously jump over obstacles up to 40 cm in height within a single control framework. Specifically, we propose new control system components, layered on top of a low-level running controller, which actively modify the approach and select stance force profiles as required to clear a sensed obstacle. The approach controller enables the quadruped to end in a preferable state relative to the obstacle just before the jump. This multi-step gait planning is formulated as a multiple-horizon model predictive control problem and solved at each step through quadratic pro-gramming. Ground reaction force profiles to execute the running jump are selected through constrained nonlinear optimization on a simplified model of the robot that possesses polynomial dynamics. Exploiting the simplified structure of these dynamics, the presented method greatly accelerates the computation of otherwise costly function and constraint evaluations that are required during optimization. With these considerations, the new algorithms allow for online planning that is critical for reliable response to unexpected situations. Experimental results, for a stand-alone quadruped with on-board power and computation, show the viability of this approach, and represent important steps towards broader dynamic maneuverability in experimental machines.},

Due to the multiple contact modes associated with frictional interactions, the resulting optimization program suffers from combinatorial complexity when tasked with determining the optimal sequence of modes. To overcome this difficulty, we formulate the search for the optimal mode sequences offline, separately from the search for optimal control inputs online. Using tools from machine learning, this leads to a convex hybrid MPC program that can be solved in real-time. We validate our algorithm with the problem of pushing a planar object of arbitrary shape with an arbitrary number of contact points.},

They have important theoretical benefits but have never been implemented on a torque controlled robot where model inaccuracies and real-time computation requirements can be problematic. In this contribution we present experimental results for the control of the lower body of a humanoid robot using these algorithms. We propose a simplification of the optimization problem that allows us to decrease computation time enough to implement it in a fast torque control loop. Experiments demonstrate the applicability of the approach. In a first experiment, we implement a momentum-based balance controller which shows robust performance in face of unknown disturbances. In a second experiment, a tracking task is evaluated to demonstrate the performance of the controller with more complicated hierarchies. Our results show that hierarchical inverse dynamics controllers can be efficiently used for feedback control of humanoid robots and that momentum-based balance control can be efficiently implemented on a real robot.},

abstract = {Control barrier functions have been demonstrated to be a useful method of ensuring constraint satisfaction for a wide class of controllers. However, the existing results are mostly restricted to continuous-time systems. Mechanical systems, including robots, are typically second-order systems in which the control occurs at the force/torque level. These systems have actuator, velocity, and position constraints (i.e., relative degree two) that are vital for safety and/or task execution. Additionally, mechanical systems are typically controlled digitally as sampled-data systems. The contribution of this article is twofold. The first contribution is the development of novel, robust control barrier functions that ensure constraint satisfaction for sampled-data systems in the presence of model uncertainty and allows for satisfaction of actuator constraints. The second contribution is the application of the proposed method to the challenging problem of robotic grasping in which a robotic hand must ensure that an object remains inside the grasp while manipulating it to the desired reference trajectory. A grasp constraint satisfying controller is proposed that can admit the existing nominal manipulation controllers from the literature while simultaneously ensuring no slip, no overextension (e.g., singular configurations), and no rolling off of the fingertips. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed control for the robotic hand application.},

abstract = {Torque control algorithms which consider robot dynamics and contact constraints are important for creating dynamic behaviors for humanoids. As computational power increases, algorithms tend to also increase in complexity. However, it is not clear how much complexity is really required to create controllers which exhibit good performance. In this paper, we study the capabilities of a simple approach based on contact consistent LQR controllers designed around key poses to control various tasks on a humanoid robot. We present extensive experimental results on a hydraulic, torque controlled humanoid performing balancing and stepping tasks. This feedback control approach captures the necessary synergies between the DoFs of the robot to guarantee good control performance. We show that for the considered tasks, it is only necessary to re-linearize the dynamics of the robot at different contact configurations and that increasing the number of LQR controllers along desired trajectories does not improve performance. Our result suggest that very simple controllers can yield good performance competitive with current state of the art, but more complex, optimization-based whole-body controllers.

abstract = {Simulations are attractive environments for training agents as they provide an abundant source of data and alleviate certain safety concerns during the training process. But the behaviours developed by agents in simulation are often specific to the characteristics of the simulator. Due to modeling error, strategies that are successful in simulation may not transfer to their real world counterparts. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple method to bridge this "reality gap". By randomizing the dynamics of the simulator during training, we are able to develop policies that are capable of adapting to very different dynamics, including ones that differ significantly from the dynamics on which the policies were trained. This adaptivity enables the policies to generalize to the dynamics of the real world without any training on the physical system. Our approach is demonstrated on an object pushing task using a robotic arm. Despite being trained exclusively in simulation, our policies are able to maintain a similar level of performance when deployed on a real robot, reliably moving an object to a desired location from random initial configurations. We explore the impact of various design decisions and show that the resulting policies are robust to significant calibration error.},

For the double support case encountered in humanoids, this problem is underspecified, and provides the opportunity to optimize desired foot centers of pressure (CoPs) and forces. In different contexts, we may seek CoPs and contact forces that optimize actuator effort or decrease the tendency for foot roll. In this work, we present two formulations of the FDP for humanoids in double support, and propose objective functions within a general framework to address the variety of competing requirements for the realization of balance. As a key feature, the framework is capable to optimize contact forces for motions on uneven terrain. Solutions for the formulations developed are obtained with a commercial nonlinear optimization package and through analytical approaches on a simplified problem. Results are shown for a highly dynamic whole-body humanoid reaching motion performed on even terrain and on a ramp. A convex formulation of the FDP provides real-time solutions with computation times of a few milliseconds. While the convex formulation does not include CoPs explicitly as optimization variables, a novel objective function is developed which penalizes foot CoP solutions that approach the foot boundaries.},

In this work, we present a method that examines the effects of adjusting the step timing to produce plans that only require a specified amount of knee bend to execute. We define a quadratic program that optimizes the step timings and is executed this using a simple iterative feedback approach to account for higher order terms. We then illustrate the effectiveness of this algorithm by comparing the walking gait of the simulated Atlas humanoid with and without the algorithm, showing that the algorithm significantly reduces the required knee bend for execution.

abstract = {Guided policy search is a popular approach for training controllers for high-dimensional systems, but it has a number of pitfalls. Non-convex trajectory optimization has local minima, and non-uniqueness in the optimal policy itself can mean that independently-optimized samples do not describe a coherent policy from which to train. We introduce LVIS, which circumvents the issue of local minima through global mixed-integer optimization and the issue of non-uniqueness through learning the optimal value function rather than the optimal policy. To avoid the expense of solving the mixed-integer programs to full global optimality, we instead solve them only partially, extracting intervals containing the true cost-to-go from early termination of the branch-and-bound algorithm. These interval samples are used to weakly supervise the training of a neural net which approximates the true cost-to-go. Online, we use that learned cost-to-go as the terminal cost of a one-step model-predictive controller, which we solve via a small mixed-integer optimization. We demonstrate LVIS on piecewise affine models of a cart-pole system with walls and a planar humanoid robot and show that it can be applied to a fundamentally hard problem in feedback control-control through contact.},

abstract = {This paper presents a trajectory-planning method for multibody systems. Trajectory planning of a multibody system is formulated as a constraint-solving problem on a set of variables expressing the motion of the multibody system over a finite-time interval. Constraints express the dynamics of rigid bodies, kinematic conditions of joints, various range limitations, as well as achievement of tasks, and they can be assigned different priority levels. The prioritized constraint-solving problem is then treated under the framework of lexicographical goal programming, where the local optimality of the problem is characterized in terms of Pareto efficiency condition. Based on this observation, an algorithm that iteratively updates the variables toward a locally optimal solution is derived. The proposed method is evaluated in simulation examples.},
annote = {Good work overall, but:
1) did not deal with contacts and with underactuated systems
2) algorithm converges first on highest priority task, than other tasks, similarly to what a sequence of optimizations would do (contrary to HDDP)
3) comparison with weighted approach seems unfair as they used very-close weights (10, 1, 1)

The key idea is to start by looking for a step direction such that all objectives either improve or stay the same. When such a direction does not exist, look for one such that all the objectives except for the last one improve or stay the same, and so on. This is certainly different from HDDP, where we move first in a direction that improves the first objective (regardless of what it does to the others), then a direction that improves the second objective without affecting the first one, and so on.},

The EFP provides an analytic and quantitative measure of the level of balance. Both simulation and experimental studies were conducted and compared with the previously proposed indicators, such as Capture Point (CP) and Foot Rotation Indicator (FRI). The EFP also suggests the balance augmentation by active foot tilting to create larger potential barriers. As a proof of concept, a hybrid balance controller was designed to stabilize the robot including under-actuation phases so the robot can also balance with shoes. Our study reveals that both EFP and CP successfully predict falling about 0.2s in advance for the tested robot, while the FRI fails due to the light weight of the foot and limited resolution of the force/torque measurement.},

abstract = {Compared to the traditional 2D path following case, 3D path following is more complicated since the coupling effect between horizontal and vertical plane has to be taken into account. In this paper, a sliding mode prediction controller is presented, which drives an underactuated AUV to follow a desired 3D path under time-varying current disturbances. A sliding mode technique combined with the predictive control strategy is developed to compensate for the impact of the hydrodynamic damping coupling via the feedback correction and receding horizon optimization techniques. In addition, Different from the traditional reference orientation method for path following control, here a methodology named 3D virtual guidance orientation (VGO) is built to deal with the vehicle dynamics. The geometric characteristic of tracking curve is contained in the control design as an extra degree of freedom to drive the vehicle to track a virtual target along desired path. Hence, the proposed method can avoid saturation problem of driving devices (stern plane and rudder) of AUV. Numerical simulations illustrate the excellent path following performance of the AUV in 3D under the proposed control scheme.},

One difficulty is that the fundamental principles of natural human running motions are not yet fully understood. The purpose of this paper is to show that mathematical optimization is a helpful tool to gain this insight into fast and complex motions. We present physics-based running motions for complex models of human-like running in three dimensions that have been generated by optimization. Running is modeled as a multiphase periodic motion with discontinuities, based on multibody system models of the locomotor system with actuators and spring-damper elements at each joint. The problem of generating gaits is formulated as offline optimal control problem and solved by an efficient direct multiple shooting method. We present optimization results using energy-related criteria and show that they have a close resemblance to running motions of humans. The results provide information about the internal forces and torques required to produce natural human running, as well as on the resulting kinematics. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

The deterministic policy gradient has a particularly appealing form: it is the expected gradient of the action-value function.

To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy. We demonstrate that deterministic policy gradient algorithms can significantly outperform their stochastic counterparts in high-dimensional action spaces.},

After arguing that first-order accuracy to the dynamics models is sufficient for most manipulator and locomotion robotics applications, we focus our investigation on methods for efficient, stable dynamic simulations. We describe a novel algorithm that attempts to provide smooth convergence to the true dynamics solution, which allows us to estimate the error in kinetic energy around an integration step size (as a proxy for the simulation stability). We use this algorithm to evaluate multiple hypotheses using simulation-based experiments with two virtual robot models toward developing methods for faster dynamic simulations.},

At a certain factory during the last eight years, an average of 48.9 per cent of the raffinose present in the molasses introduced was eliminated in the mother liquor. 4-In the process of washing the saccharates, notwithstanding the decided alkaline reaction of the wash waters, a small amount of sugar goes into solution. This is most noticeable in the strontium waste waters. In the mother liquor of about 30° Brix, as it runs from the presses, usually no polarization is found, whereas the waste waters of about 7° Brix show as much as 0.7 polarization. 5- As regards extraction, the barium process is the most desirable. The strontium process is also more economical than the Steffen lime process, although the discarding of molasses is a drawback as it is in the Steffen process. 6-The mother liquors of the barium and strontium processes can be concentrated easily to 42 B{\'{e}}., at which density they contain at least 12 per cent K2O and 4 per cent nitrogen. 7-As regards the fear of barium or strontium compounds being present in the granulated sugar, there has not been found even the slightest trace of such compounds in the finished products, and all prejudice against the barium and strontium processes for this reason is baseless. {\textcopyright} 1921, American Chemical Society.

Abstract— We present a novel method for computing cen-troidal dynamic trajectories in multi-contact planning context. With dynamic motion it is necessary to respect kinematic and dynamic constraints during the contact planning step. Verifying the feasibility of a transition between contacts increase the success rate of the motion generation along the planned contacts. Our approach is based on a conservative but convex reformulation of the problem where we represent the center of mass trajectory as a Bezier curve, with control points constrained by the initial and final states and one free control point. Thanks to the convexity of this formulation, we can solve it efficiently with a Linear Program of low dimension. We use this LP as a feasibility criterion to test the contact transition candidates during multi-contact planning. By incor-porating this criterion in an existing sampling-based contact planner, we are able to produce more robust contact sequences. We illustrate this application on various multi-contact scenarios. We also show that we can compute valuable initial guess, used to warm-start non-linear solvers for motion generation methods. This method could also be used for the 0 and 1-Step capturability problem.},

abstract = {Planning safe trajectories for nonlinear dynamical systems subject to model uncertainty and disturbances is challenging. In this work, we present a novel approach to tackle chance-constrained trajectory planning problems with nonconvex constraints, whereby obstacle avoidance chance constraints are reformulated using the signed distance function. We propose a novel sequential convex programming algorithm and prove that under a discrete time problem formulation, it is guaranteed to converge to a solution satisfying first-order optimality conditions. We demonstrate the approach on an uncertain 6 degrees of freedom spacecraft system and show that the solutions satisfy a given set of chance constraints.},

abstract = {In this paper, a robust formulation for the structure-control design of mechatronic systems is developed. The proposed robust approach aims at minimization of the sensitivity of the nominal design objectives with respect to uncertain parameters. The robust integrated design problem is established as a nonlinear multiobjective dynamic optimization one, which in order to consider synergetic interactions uses mechanical and control nominal design objectives. A planar parallel robot and its controller are simultaneously designed with the proposed approach when the nominal design objectives are the tracking error and the manipulability measure. The payload at the end-effector is considered as the uncertain parameter. Experimental results show that a robustly designed parallel robot presents lower sensitivity of the nominal design objectives under the effects of changes at the payload than a nonrobustly designed one. {\textcopyright} 1996-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The reinforcement learning paradigm allows, in principle, for complex behaviours to be learned directly from simple reward signals. In practice, however, it is common to carefully hand-design the reward function to encourage a particular solution, or to derive it from demonstration data. In this paper explore how a rich environment can help to promote the learning of complex behavior. Specifically, we train agents in diverse environmental contexts, and find that this encourages the emergence of robust behaviours that perform well across a suite of tasks. We demonstrate this principle for locomotion -- behaviours that are known for their sensitivity to the choice of reward. We train several simulated bodies on a diverse set of challenging terrains and obstacles, using a simple reward function based on forward progress. Using a novel scalable variant of policy gradient reinforcement learning, our agents learn to run, jump, crouch and turn as required by the environment without explicit reward-based guidance. A visual depiction of highlights of the learned behavior can be viewed following https://youtu.be/hx_bgoTF7bs .},

abstract = {The sensorimotor system is a product of evolution, development, learning and adaptation-which work on different time scales to improve behavioral performance. Consequently, many theories of motor function are based on 'optimal performance': they quantify task goals as cost functions, and apply the sophisticated tools of optimal control theory to obtain detailed behavioral predictions. The resulting models, although not without limitations, have explained more empirical phenomena than any other class. Traditional emphasis has been on optimizing desired movement trajectories while ignoring sensory feedback. Recent work has redefined optimality in terms of feedback control laws, and focused on the mechanisms that generate behavior online. This approach has allowed researchers to fit previously unrelated concepts and observations into what may become a unified theoretical framework for interpreting motor function. At the heart of the framework is the relationship between high-level goals, and the real-time sensorimotor control strategies most suitable for accomplishing those goals.},

MHPC is formulated as a multi-phase receding-horizon Trajectory Optimization (TO) problem, and is solved by an efficient solver called Hybrid Systems Differential Dynamic Programming (HSDDP). MHPC is benchmarked in simulation on a quadruped, a biped, and a quadrotor, demonstrating control performance on par or exceeding whole-body MPC while maintaining a lower computational cost in each case.

For tasks such as grasping, there are no reliable success measures available. Defining reward functions by hand requires extensive task knowledge and often leads to undesired emergent behavior. Instead, we propose to learn the reward function through active learning, querying human expert knowledge for a subset of the agent's rollouts. We introduce a framework, wherein a traditional learning algorithm interplays with the reward learning component, such that the evolution of the action learner guides the queries of the reward learner.

The focus here is on assessing the robustness of this arrangement when the vehicle real forward dynamics is not identically cancelled by the inverse model due to model approximations and parameter uncertainties. The trajectories that are considered are analytic solutions of the minimum square jerk optimal control problem for a simplified kinematic vehicle model in curvilinear coordinates. Various hypotheses are made concerning the mismatch between the inverse model and the actual forward dynamics of the vehicle. Closed-loop stability analysis shows that the studied control scheme guarantees asymptotic stability of both the nominal and the perturbed kinematic model with significant robustness margins. In addition to the theoretical robustness analysis, the same control scheme is validated in simulation using the industry-standard software for virtual vehicle testing IPG CarMaker.},

abstract = {CVXGEN is a software tool that takes a high level description of a convex optimization problem family, and automatically generates custom C code that compiles into a reliable, high speed solver for the problem family. The current implementation targets problem families that can be transformed, using disciplined convex programming techniques, to convex quadratic programs of modest size. CVXGEN generates simple, flat, library-free code suitable for embedding in real-time applications. The generated code is almost branch free, and so has highly predictable run-time behavior. The combination of regularization (both static and dynamic) and iterative refinement in the search direction computation yields reliable performance, even with poor quality data. In this paper we describe how CVXGEN is implemented, and give some results on the speed and reliability of the automatically generated solvers.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. The identification of inertial parameters is crucial to achieve high-performance model-based control of legged robots. The inertial parameters of the legs are typically not altered during expeditions and therefore are best identified offline. On the other hand, the trunk parameters depend on the modules mounted on the robot, like a motor to provide the hydraulic power, or different sets of cameras for perception. This motivates the use of recursive approaches to identify online mass and the position of the Center of Mass (CoM) of the robot trunk, when a payload change occurs. We propose two such approaches and analyze their robustness in simulation. Furthermore, experimental trials on our 80-kg quadruped robot HyQ show the applicability of our strategies during locomotion to cope with large payload changes that would otherwise severely compromise the balance of the robot.},

abstract = {We propose a class of very simple modifications of gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. We show that when applied to a large variety of machine learning problems, ranging from logistic regression to deep neural nets, the proposed surrogates can dramatically reduce the variance, allow to take a larger step size, and improve the generalization accuracy. The methods only involve multiplying the usual (stochastic) gradient by the inverse of a positive definitive matrix (which can be computed efficiently by FFT) with a low condition number coming from a one-dimensional discrete Laplacian or its high order generalizations. It also preserves the mean and increases the smallest component and decreases the largest component. The theory of Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations demonstrates that the implicit version of the new algorithm is almost the same as doing gradient descent on a new function which (i) has the same global minima as the original function and (ii) is ``more convex". Moreover, we show that optimization algorithms with these surrogates converge uniformly in the discrete Sobolev $H_\sigma^p$ sense and reduce the optimality gap for convex optimization problems.

abstract = {The proven efficacy of learning-based control schemes strongly motivates their application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However, guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. We propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process. We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-Time validation. The result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes only when the computed safety guarantees require it, or confidence in the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We prove theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysis and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle. Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policy-gradient reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a strong external disturbance introduced during flight.},

In this paper, we present a system to automate this process by leveraging deep reinforcement learning techniques. Our system can learn quadruped locomotion from scratch using simple reward signals. In addition, users can provide an open loop reference to guide the learning process when more control over the learned gait is needed. The control policies are learned in a physics simulator and then deployed on real robots. In robotics, policies trained in simulation often do not transfer to the real world. We narrow this reality gap by improving the physics simulator and learning robust policies. We improve the simulation using system identification, developing an accurate actuator model and simulating latency. We learn robust controllers by randomizing the physical environments, adding perturbations and designing a compact observation space. We evaluate our system on two agile locomotion gaits: trotting and galloping. After learning in simulation, a quadruped robot can successfully perform both gaits in the real world.},

abstract = {The inspection of sizeable plate-based metal structures such as storage tanks or marine vessel hulls is a significant stake in the industry, which necessitates reliable and time-efficient solutions. Although Lamb waves have been identified as a promising solution for long-range non-destructive testing, and despite the substantial progress made in autonomous navigation and environment sensing, a Lamb-wave-based robotic system for extensive structure monitoring is still lacking. Following previous work on ultrasonic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), we introduce a method to achieve plate geometry inference without prior knowledge of the material propagation properties, which may be lacking during a practical inspection task in challenging and outdoor environments. Our approach combines focalization to adjust the propagation model parameters and beamforming to infer the plate boundaries location by relying directly on acoustic measurements acquired along the mobile unit trajectory. For each candidate model, the focusing ability of the corresponding beamformer is assessed over high-pass filtered beamforming maps to further improve the robustness of the plate geometry estimates. We then recover the optimal space-domain beamformer through a simulated annealing optimization process. We evaluate our method on three sets of experimental data acquired in different conditions and show that accurate plate geometry inference can be achieved without any prior propagation model. Finally, the results show that the optimal beamformer outperforms the beamformer resulting from the predetermined propagation model in non-nominal acquisition conditions.},

abstract = {This paper develops an approach for driver-aware vehicle control based on stochastic model predictive control with learning (SMPCL). The framework combines the on-board learning of a Markov chain that represents the driver behavior, a scenario-based approach for stochastic optimization, and quadratic programming. By using quadratic programming, SMPCL can handle, in general, larger state dimension models than stochastic dynamic programming, and can reconfigure in real-time for accommodating changes in driver behavior. The SMPCL approach is demonstrated in the energy management of a series hybrid electrical vehicle, aimed at improving fuel efficiency while enforcing constraints on battery state of charge and power. The SMPCL controller allocates the power from the battery and the engine to meet the driver power request. A Markov chain that models the power request dynamics is learned in real-time to improve the prediction capabilities of model predictive control (MPC). Because of exploiting the learned pattern of the driver behavior, the proposed approach outperforms conventional model predictive control and shows performance close to MPC with full knowledge of future driver power request in standard and real-world driving cycles.},

abstract = {Autonomous robot tasks involving contacts with the environment must be performed under active force control if the geometric uncertainties in the task models are too large to cope with by means of passive compliance only. In practice, task specification of force-controlled actions is closely linked to the Task Frame Formalism (TFF), also known as the compliance frame formalism. The TFF is a very intuitive and controller independent approach to model a motion constraint, and to specify the desired forces and motions compatible with this constraint. However, it has never been defined clearly and unambiguously, and it cannot cope with all possible constrained motion tasks. This paper provides, for the first time, a formal definition of what makes up a TFF task specification. It gives also a synthesis of which tasks the TFF can cope with, and proposes a generic textual task specification formalism. Finally, it describes an example constrained motion task that the TFF cannot handle. {\textcopyright} 1996 IEEE.},

abstract = {Trajectory optimization and posture generation are hard problems in robot locomotion, which can be non-convex and have multiple local optima. Progress on these problems is further hindered by a lack of open benchmarks, since comparisons of different solutions are difficult to make. In this paper we introduce a new benchmark for trajectory optimization and posture generation of legged robots, using a pre-defined scenario, robot and constraints, as well as evaluation criteria. We evaluate state-of-the-art trajectory optimization algorithms based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) on the benchmark, as well as new stochastic and incremental optimization methods borrowed from the large-scale machine learning literature. Interestingly we show that some of these stochastic and incremental methods, which are based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD), achieve higher success rates than SQP on tough initializations. Inspired by this observation we also propose a new incremental variant of SQP which updates only a random subset of the costs and constraints at each iteration. The algorithm is the best performing in both success rate and convergence speed, improving over SQP by up to 30% in both criteria. The benchmark's resources and a solution evaluation script are made openly available.},

@article{Dadebo1995,
abstract = {In many chemical engineering process control applications, one frequently encounters differential-algebraic optimization problems. Such optimal control problems are difficult to solve, in general, because of the presence of singular arcs for systems whose Hamiltonian is linear with respect to the control variable. We propose the use of absolute error penalty functions (AEPF) in handling constrained optimal control problems in chemical engineering by posing the problem as a nonsmooth dynamic optimization problem. We show that Iterative dynamic programming (IDP) is a very useful technique for solving constrained dynamic optimization problems without unduly increasing the dimension of the system or the computational burden. A move suppression criterion has been incorporated into the IDP algorithm in order to penalize excessive control moves. To show the efficacy of the method, an analytical (exact) solution of a simple problem is obtained using least squares control theory and compared with results obtained using IDP. Results obtained for other seemingly difficult optimal control problems in chemical engineering compare very favourably with those reported in the optimization and optimal control literature. {\textcopyright} 1995, All rights reserved.},

@article{Pardo2017,
abstract = {—In this paper, we present an algorithm for planning and control of legged robot locomotion. Given the desired contact sequence, this method generates gaits and dynamic motions for legged robots without resorting to simplified stability criteria. The method uses direct collocation for searching for solutions within the constraint-consistent subspace defined by the robot's contact configuration. For the differential equation constraints of the collocation algorithm, we use the so-called direct dynamics of a constrained multibody system. The dynamics of a legged robot is different for each contact configuration. Our method deals with such a hybrid nature, and it allows for velocity discontinuities when contacts are made. We introduce the projected impact dynamics constraint to enforce consistency during mode switching. We stabilize the plan using an inverse dynamics controller compatible with the optimal feed-forward control of the motion plan. As a whole, this approach reduces the complexity associated with specifying dynamic motions of a floating-base robot under the constant influence of contact forces. We apply this method on a hydraulically-actuated quadruped robot. We show two types of gaits (walking and trotting) as well as diverse jumping motions (forward, sideways, turning) on the real system. The results presented here are one of the few examples of an optimal control problem solved and satisfactorily transferred to a real torque-controlled legged robot.},

abstract = {We present a novel algorithm for the computational co-design of legged robots and dynamic maneuvers. Current state-of-the-art approaches are based on random sampling or concurrent optimization. A few recently proposed methods explore the relationship between the gradient of the optimal motion and robot design. Inspired by these approaches, we propose a bilevel optimization approach that exploits the derivatives of the motion planning sub-problem (the inner level) without simplifying assumptions on its structure. Our approach can quickly optimize the robot's morphology while considering its full dynamics, joint limits and physical constraints such as friction cones. It has a faster convergence rate and greater scalability for larger design problems than state-of-the-art approaches based on sampling methods. It also allows us to handle constraints such as the actuation limits, which are important for co-designing dynamic maneuvers. We demonstrate these capabilities by studying jumping and trotting gaits under different design metrics and verify our results in a physics simulator. For these cases, our algorithm converges in less than a third of the number of iterations needed for sampling approaches, and the computation time scales linearly.},

abstract = {Recent work has developed methods for learning deep network classifiers that are provably robust to norm-bounded adversarial perturbation; however, these methods are currently only possible for relatively small feedforward networks. In this paper, in an effort to scale these approaches to substantially larger models, we extend previous work in three main directions. First, we present a technique for extending these training procedures to much more general networks, with skip connections (such as ResNets) and general nonlinearities; the approach is fully modular, and can be implemented automatically (analogous to automatic differentiation). Second, in the specific case of `∞ adversarial perturbations and networks with ReLU nonlinearities, we adopt a nonlinear random projection for training, which scales linearly in the number of hidden units (previous approaches scaled quadratically). Third, we show how to further improve robust error through cascade models. On both MNIST and CIFAR data sets, we train classifiers that improve substantially on the state of the art in provable robust adversarial error bounds: from 5.8% to 3.1% on MNIST (with `∞ perturbations of $\epsilon$ = 0.1), and from 80% to 36.4% on CIFAR (with `∞ perturbations of $\epsilon$ = 2/255).

abstract = {This paper addresses the sensitivity analysis for hybrid systems with discontinuous (jumping) state trajectories. We consider state-triggered jumps in the state evolution, potentially accompanied by mode switching in the control vector field as well. For a given trajectory with state jumps, we show how to construct an approximation of a nearby perturbed trajectory corresponding to a small variation of the initial condition and input. A major complication in the construction of such an approximation is that, in general, the jump times corresponding to a nearby perturbed trajectory are not equal to those of the nominal one. The main contribution of this work is the development of a notion of error to clarify in which sense the approximate trajectory is, at each instant of time, a firstorder approximation of the perturbed trajectory. This notion of error naturally finds application in the (local) tracking problem of a time-varying reference trajectory of a hybrid system. To illustrate the possible use of this new error definition in the context of trajectory tracking, we outline how the standard linear trajectory tracking control for nonlinear systems -based on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory to compute the optimal feedback gain- could be generalized for hybrid systems.},

abstract = {This paper introduces effective numerical methods for the planning and fast replanning of safe motions to ensure the safety, balance, and integrity of humanoid robots over the whole motion duration. Our safe methods do not depend on, nor are connected to, any type of modeling or constraints. To plan safe motions, certain constraints have to be satisfied over a continuous interval of time. Classical methods revert to time-grid discretization, which can be risky for the robot. We introduce a hybrid method to plan safe motions, which combines a classical unsafe method with a verification step that checks constraint violation and computes excess by the usage of interval analysis. When the robot meets unexpected situations, it has to replan a new motion, which is often too time consuming. Hence, we introduce a new method to rapidly replan safe motions, i.e., in less than 2 s CPU time. It computes offline feasible subsets in the vicinity of safe motions and finds online a solution in these subsets without actually recomputing the nonlinear constraints. Our methods are validated by the use the HOAP-3 robot, where the motions are run with no balance controller.},

The variation in contact configuration (e.g., standing on one foot, on uneven ground, or while holding on for support) presents a difficult challenge for interactive simulation of humans and animals, especially while performing tasks in the presence of external disturbances. We describe an analytic approach for control of standing in three-dimensional simulations based upon local optimization. At any point in time, the control system solves a quadratic program to compute actuation by maximizing the performance of multiple motion objectives subject to constraints imposed by actuation limits and contact configuration.

abstract = {This monograph focuses on sensor integration in robotics, in particular in robotic manipulation control systems.We consider a mechanical system with multiple degrees of freedom equipped with one or more sensors delivering digital and/or analog sensor signals. There is no question that sensor inte- gration and sensor-based control belong to the dominating domains for the future advancement of robotic systems. Although there has been much re- search on this objective, there is still one important question that has not been answered yet: If we consider a robot in an arbitrary state ofmotion, how can we calculate a trajectory, if we want the robot to react instantaneously to unforeseen sensor events? The core part derives a class of algorithms that generate motion trajecto- ries for robotics systems on-line, that is, within one control cycle (typically one millisecond or less). Such an algorithm is executed in parallel to low-level motion controllers, and systems using it are able to react instantaneously to unforeseen (sensor) events. In order to answer the above question, the al- gorithm enables switchings from sensor-guided robot motion control (e.g., force/torque or visual servo control) to trajectory-following motion control and vice versa, which is an important feature for the practical realization of sensor-based robot motion control systems. The proposed on-line trajectory generation algorithm acts as an open-loop pose controller at an intermediate control layer that functions as one element of the important bridge between low-level robot motion control and higher-level (sensor-based) motion plan- ning. Furthermore, it enables robotic systems to perform a kind of robotic reflex. As the first derivation step, the algorithm is developed for systems with one actuator only, and subsequently it becomes extended to be applicable in robotic systems with multiple degrees of freedom. The generated trajectories are time-optimal and synchronized for all degrees of freedom, such that all degrees of freedom reach their target at the same time instant. Using the proposed on-line trajectory generation algorithm as one control submodule in a hybrid switched-control system simplifies the execution of XIV Abstract sensor-guided and sensor-guarded motions. As the algorithm is able to take over control at any time instant and in any state of motion, safe and contin- uous motions can be guaranteed—even if sensors fail. An additional benefit is that unforeseen (sensor-dependent) switchings of reference frames and/or control spaces become possible. The proposed concept is of a very basic nature and, thus, addresses various fields of robotics, in which sensor integration plays a fundamental role, for example, in service robotics, manipulation control systems, mobile robotics and manipulation, and robotic surgery. Samples and use-cases accompany the book in order to provide a comprehensible insight into this interesting and relevant field of robotics.},

Our method handles keyframed motions, highly-dynamic actions such as motion-captured flips and spins, and retargeted motions. By combining a motion-imitation objective with a task objective, we can train characters that react intelligently in interactive settings, e.g., by walking in a desired direction or throwing a ball at a user-specified target. This approach thus combines the convenience and motion quality of using motion clips to define the desired style and appearance, with the flexibility and generality afforded by RL methods and physics-based animation. We further explore a number of methods for integrating multiple clips into the learning process to develop multi-skilled agents capable of performing a rich repertoire of diverse skills. We demonstrate results using multiple characters (human, Atlas robot, bipedal dinosaur, dragon) and a large variety of skills, including locomotion, acrobatics, and martial arts.},

@article{Nevejans2017,
abstract = {With a view to developments in robotics and artificial intelligence, the Committee on Legal Affairs deemed it time for the European Union to take action in respect of the legal and ethical issues raised by these new technologies. To this end, the JURI Committee set up a working group in 2015 with the primary aim of drawing up “European” civil law rules in this area (lege ferenda). While respecting the European Commission's right of initiative, on 31 May 2016 this group delivered a draft report (Initiative – Article 46 of theEP's Rules of procedure) setting out a series of recommendations on civil law rules on robotics1. This draft includes a motion for a European Parliament resolution, accompanied by an annex containing detailed recommendations for the content of a possible legislative proposal. It also includes an explanatory statement which points out that the aim of the future instrument is to lay down the “general and ethical principles governing the development of robotics and artificial intelligence for civil purposes”. Scientific research on these emerging technologies seems to imply that they will change the face of society. Therefore, even if robots are not yet commonplace, the time has come to legislate. Once a new legal and ethical sector surfaces, a general approach to the big theoretical questions needs to be found in the first instance, so as to eliminate any misunderstanding or misconceptions about robotics and artificial intelligence. When we consider civil liability in robotics, we come up against fanciful visions about robots. Here we must resist calls to establish a legal personality based on science fiction. This will become all the more crucial once the liability law solutions adopted in respect of autonomous robots determine whether this new market booms or busts. Developments in civil robotics and artificial intelligence also call for reflection on the big ethical questions they raise. This analysis is complicated by the fact that it is difficult to predict what sometimes remains an experiment. In this regard, it is essential that the big ethical principles which will come to govern robotics develop in perfect harmony with Europe's humanist values. The “Charter on Robotics”, which was introduced in the draft report, moves in this direction},

abstract = {— Hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) has emerged as a popular framework for dynamic and underactuated bipedal walking, but has significant implementation difficulties when applied to the high degrees of freedom present in humanoid robots. The primary impediment is the process of gait design– it is difficult for optimizers to converge on a viable set of virtual constraints defining a gait. This paper presents a methodology that allows for the fast and reliable generation of efficient multi-contact robotic walking gaits through the framework of HZD, even in the presence of underactuation. To achieve this goal, we unify methods from trajectory optimization with the control framework of multi-domain hybrid zero dynamics. By formulating a novel optimization problem in the context of direct collocation and generating analytic Jacobians for the constraints, solving the resulting nonlinear program becomes tractable for large-scale nonlinear programming solvers, even for systems as high-dimensional as humanoid robots. We experimentally validated our methodology on the spring-legged prototype humanoid, DURUS, showing that the optimization approach yields dynamic and stable 3D walking gaits.},

abstract = {Real organisms live in a world full of uncertain situations and have evolved cognitive mechanisms to cope with problems based on actions and perceptions which are not always reliable. One aspect could be related with the following questions: could neural uncertainty be beneficial from an evolutionary robotics perspective? Is uncertainty a possible mechanism for obtaining more robust artificial systems? Using the minimal cognition approach, we show that moderate levels of uncertainty in the dynamics of continuous-time recurrent networks correlates positively with behavioral robustness of the system. This correlation is possible through internal neural changes depending on the uncertainty level. We also find that controllers evolved with moderate neural uncertainty remain robust to disruptions even when uncertainty is removed during tests, suggesting that uncertainty helps evolution find regions of higher robustness in parameter space.},

abstract = {Time-Optimal Path Parameterization (TOPP) is a well-studied problem in robotics and has a wide range of applications. There are two main families of methods to address TOPP: Numerical Integration (NI) and Convex Optimization (CO). NI-based methods are fast but difficult to implement and suffer from robustness issues, while CO-based approaches are more robust but at the same time significantly slower. Here we propose a new approach to TOPP based on Reachability Analysis (RA). The key insight is to recursively compute reachable and controllable sets at discretized positions on the path by solving small Linear Programs (LPs). The resulting algorithm is faster than NI-based methods and as robust as CO-based ones (100% success rate), as confirmed by extensive numerical evaluations. Moreover, the proposed approach offers unique additional benefits: Admissible Velocity Propagation and robustness to parametric uncertainty can be derived from it in a simple and natural way.},

Analytical rigid-body contact models are used extensively in planning and control due to their computational efficiency and simplicity, yet despite their prevalence, little if any empirical comparison of these models has been made and it is unclear how well they approximate contact outcomes. In this paper, we first formulate a system identification approach for six commonly used contact models in the literature, and use the proposed method to find parameters for an experimental data-set of impacts. Next, we compare the models empirically, and establish a task specific upper bound on the performance of the models and the rigid-body contact model paradigm. We highlight the limitations of these models, salient failure modes, and the care that should be taken in parameter selection, which are ultimately difficult to give a physical interpretation.},

abstract = {In this paper, the main goal is to present an experimental comparison of the two prevailing contact modeling approaches of bipedal locomotion, i. e. rigid versus compliant contact model. To do this, first, an explicit dynamics model for the robot multibody with rigid model of contact for various phases of walking is developed. Then, in order to develop a model with compliant contact, a physically oriented software is exploited and using its tools the robot multibody is modeled. To model the unilateral contact in interaction points in this software, a nonlinear compliant contact model is proposed. Finally, the drive mechanism dynamics is modeled through a linear identification routine. By adding the drive system dynamics to both models, the procedure of modeling is completed. In order to compare the performance of the developed models, obtained results from these models are compared to the empirical measurements from bipedal walking of the human-size humanoid robot SURENA III, which has been designed and fabricated at CAST, university of Tehran. This comparison shows the merit of both models in estimating dynamic behavior, while the model with rigid contact with less complexity can be employed for model-based motion optimization, analysis as well as control, and the model with compliant contact with more complexity is suitable for more realistic simulation scenarios.},

We also present a novel foot contact sensor suitable for legged locomotion with hard impacts. A 2.2 kg quadruped robot with a large range of motion is assembled from eight identical actuator modules and four lower legs with foot contact sensors. Leveraging standard plastic 3D printing and off-the-shelf parts results in a lightweight and inexpensive robot, allowing for rapid distribution and duplication within the research community. We systematically characterize the achieved impedance at the foot in both static and dynamic scenarios, and measure a maximum dimensionless leg stiffness of 10.8 without active damping, which is comparable to the leg stiffness of a running human. Finally, to demonstrate the capabilities of the quadruped, we present a novel controller which combines feedforward contact forces computed from a kino-dynamic optimizer with impedance control of the center of mass and base orientation. The controller can regulate complex motions while being robust to environmental uncertainty.},

abstract = {We present in this paper a novel nonlinear model predictive control scheme that guarantees asymptotic closed-loop stability. The scheme can be applied to both stable and unstable systems with input constraints. The objective functional to be minimized consists of an integral square error (ISE) part over a finite time horizon plus a quadratic terminal cost. The terminal state penalty matrix of the terminal cost term has to be chosen as the solution of an appropriate Lyapunov equation. Furthermore, the setup includes a terminal inequality constraint that forces the states at the end of the finite prediction horizon to lie within a prescribed terminal region. If the Jacobian linearization of the nonlinear system to be controlled is stabilizable, we prove that feasibility of the open-loop optimal control problem at time t = 0 implies asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. The size of the region of attraction is only restricted by the requirement for feasibility of the optimization problem due to the input and terminal inequality constraints and is thus maximal in some sense. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The approach closely follows the formulation of the simulated annealing algorithm as originally given for discrete optimization problems. The mathematical formulation is extended to continuous optimization problems, and we prove asymptotic convergence to the set of global optima. Furthermore, we discuss an implementation of the algorithm and compare its performance with other well-known algorithms.

We consider both models with a generic layer architecture and models with specialised topologies that hard-wire physics principles. Network pre-wiring is limited to universal laws; hence it does not limit the network modelling abilities on one side but allows more robust and interpretable models on the other side. Four different network types (with and without pre-wired structure, recursive and non-recursive) are compared for the longitudinal dynamics of a car with gears and two controls (brake and engine). Results show that pre-wiring effectively improves the performance. Non-recursive networks also look to be preferable for several reasons.},

abstract = {— An inspiration for developing a bipedal walking system is the ability to navigate rough terrain with discrete footholds like stepping stones. In this paper, we present a novel methodology to overcome the problem of dynamic walking over stepping stones with significant random changes to step length and step height at each step. Using a 2-step gait optimization, we not only consider the desired location of the next footstep but also the current configuration of the robot, thereby resolving the problem of step transition when we switch between different walking gaits. We then use gait interpolation to generate the desired walking gait in real-time. We demonstrate the method on a planar dynamical walking model of ATRIAS, an underactuated bipedal robot walking over a randomly generated stepping stones with step length and step height changing in the range of [30:80] (cm) and [-30:30] (cm) respectively. Experimental validation on the real robot was also successful for the problem of dynamic walking on stepping stones with step lengths varied within [23:78] (cm) and average walking speed of 0.6 (m/s).},

Reduction of the number of variables of the QP formulation. Joint accelerations are completely removed. Torques are reduced to the part in the nullspace of the contact Jacobian J. The contact forces are reduced to the part in the nullspace of (U J^T).
Comments 
Some passages are not clear, for instance when passing from tau to z in (27).
I liked the idea of limiting the inequality constraints on the contact forces to having enough forces to satisfy the condition on the rank of JU^T. However I'm not sure that this is done properly in the paper, because it is in the form (40), i.e. f>0, which is fine only for normal forces. 
Improvements 
It may be possible to achieve the same reduction without having to decompose the mass matrix.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the optimal control problem known as the linear quadratic regulator in the case when the dynamics are unknown. We propose a multistage procedure, called Coarse-ID control, that estimates a model from a few experimental trials, estimates the error in that model with respect to the truth, and then designs a controller using both the model and uncertainty estimate. Our technique uses contemporary tools from random matrix theory to bound the error in the estimation procedure. We also employ a recently developed approach to control synthesis called System Level Synthesis that enables robust control design by solving a quasi-convex optimization problem. We provide end-to-end bounds on the relative error in control cost that are optimal in the number of parameters and that highlight salient properties of the system to be controlled such as closed-loop sensitivity and optimal control magnitude. We show experimentally that the Coarse-ID approach enables efficient computation of a stabilizing controller in regimes where simple control schemes that do not take the model uncertainty into account fail to stabilize the true system.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning for robotic applications faces the challenge of constraint satisfaction, which currently impedes its application to safety critical systems. Recent approaches successfully introduce safety based on reachability analysis, determining a safe region of the state space where the system can operate. However, overly constraining the freedom of the system can negatively affect performance, while attempting to learn less conservative safety constraints might fail to preserve safety if the learned constraints are inaccurate. We propose a novel method that uses a principled approach to learn the system's unknown dynamics based on a Gaussian process model and iteratively approximates the maximal safe set. A modified control strategy based on real-time model validation preserves safety under weaker conditions than current approaches. Our framework further incorporates safety into the reinforcement learning performance metric, allowing a better integration of safety and learning. We demonstrate our algorithm on simulations of a cart-pole system and on an experimental quadrotor application and show how our proposed scheme succeeds in preserving safety where current approaches fail to avoid an unsafe condition.},

Most RL methods, in particular the most popular algorithms, do not support explicit consideration of state and input constraints. In this paper, we address this problem for nonlinear systems with continuous state and input spaces by introducing a predictive safety filter, which is able to turn a constrained dynamical system into an unconstrained safe system, to which any RL algorithm can be applied `out-of-the-box'. The predictive safety filter receives the proposed learning input and decides, based on the current system state, if it can be safely applied to the real system, or if it has to be modified otherwise. Safety is thereby established by a continuously updated safety policy, which is based on a model predictive control formulation using a data-driven system model and considering state and input dependent uncertainties.},

abstract = {We present a motion planning algorithm with probabilistic guarantees for limbed robots with stochastic gripping forces. Planners based on deterministic models with a worst-case uncertainty can be conservative and inflexible to consider the stochastic behavior of the contact, especially when a gripper is installed. Our proposed planner enables the robot to simultaneously plan its pose and contact force trajectories while considering the risk associated with the gripping forces. Our planner is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem with chance constraints, which allows the robot to generate a variety of motions based on different risk bounds. To model the gripping forces as random variables, we employ Gaussian Process regression. We validate our proposed motion planning algorithm on an 11.5 kg six-limbed robot for two-wall climbing. Our results show that our proposed planner generates various trajectories (e.g., avoiding low friction terrain under the low risk bound, choosing an unstable but faster gait under the high risk bound) by changing the probability of risk based on various specifications.},

abstract = {A central problem in motor control, in the representation of space, and in the perception of body schema is how the brain encodes the relative positions of body parts. According to psychophysical studies, this sense of limb position depends heavily on vision. However, almost nothing is currently known about how the brain uses vision to determine or represent the location of the arm or any other body part. The present experiment shows that the position of the arm is represented in the premotor cortex of the monkey (Macaca fascicularis) brain by means of a convergence of visual cues and proprioceptive cues onto the same neurons. These neurons respond to the felt position of the arm when the arm is covered from view. They also respond in a similar fashion to the seen position of a false arm.},

@article{Tin2005,
abstract = {Internal models and adaptive controls are empirical and mathematical paradigms that have evolved separately to describe learning control processes in brain systems and engineering systems, respectively. This paper presents a comprehensive appraisal of the correlation between these paradigms with a view to forging a unified theoretical framework that may benefit both disciplines. It is suggested that the classic equilibrium-point theory of impedance control of arm movement is analogous to continuous gain-scheduling or high-gain adaptive control within or across movement trials, respectively, and that the recently proposed inverse internal model is akin to adaptive sliding control originally for robotic manipulator applications. Modular internal models' architecture for multiple motor tasks is a form of multi-model adaptive control. Stochastic methods, such as generalized predictive control, reinforcement learning, Bayesian learning and Hebbian feedback covariance learning, are reviewed and their possible relevance to motor control is discussed. Possible applicability of a Luenberger observer and an extended Kalman filter to state estimation problems-such as sensorimotor prediction or the resolution of vestibular sensory ambiguity-is also discussed. The important role played by vestibular system identification in postural control suggests an indirect adaptive control scheme whereby system states or parameters are explicitly estimated prior to the implementation of control. This interdisciplinary framework should facilitate the experimental elucidation of the mechanisms of internal models in sensorimotor systems and the reverse engineering of such neural mechanisms into novel brain-inspired adaptive control paradigms in future.},

abstract = {The recent successes in deep reinforcement learning largely rely on the capabilities of generating masses of data, which in turn implies the use of a simulator. In particular, current progress in multi body dynamic simulators are under-pinning the implementation of reinforcement learning for end-to-end control of robotic systems. Yet simulators are mostly considered as black boxes while we have the knowledge to make them produce a richer information. In this paper, we are proposing to use the derivatives of the simulator to help with the convergence of the learning. For that, we combine model-based trajectory optimization to produce informative trials using 1st- and 2nd-order simulation derivatives. These locally-optimal runs give fair estimates of the value function and its derivatives, that we use to accelerate the convergence of the critics using Sobolev learning. We empirically demonstrate that the algorithm leads to a faster and more accurate estimation of the value function. The resulting value estimate is used in model-predictive controller as a proxy for shortening the preview horizon. We believe that it is also a first step toward superlinear reinforcement learning algorithm using simulation derivatives, that we need for end-to-end legged locomotion.},

abstract = {A humanoid walking robot is a highly nonlinear dynamical system that relies strongly on contact forces between its feet and the ground in order to realize stable motions, but these contact forces are unfortunately severely limited. Model predictive control, also known as receding horizon control, is a general control scheme specifically designed to deal with such constrained dynamical systems, with the potential ability to react efficiently to a wide range of situations. Apart from the question of computation time which needs to be taken care of carefully (these schemes can be highly computation intensive), the initial question of which optimal control problems should be considered to be solved online in order to lead to the desired walking movements is still unanswered. A key idea for answering to this problem can be found in the ZMP preview control scheme. After presenting here this scheme with a point of view slightly different from the original one, we focus on the problem of compensating strong perturbations of the dynamics of the robot and propose a new linear model predictive control scheme which is an improvement of the original ZMP preview control scheme.},

@book{Bishop2006,
abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. A forthcoming companion volume will deal with practical aspects of pattern recognition and machine learning, and will include free software implementations of the key algorithms along with example data sets and demonstration programs. Christopher Bishop is Assistant Director at Microsoft Research Cambridge, and also holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, and was recently elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. The author's previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely adopted.},

Despite some scattered results, a principled approach towards "when and where to take a step" has not yet emerged. Towards this goal, we present methods for computing capture points and the capture region, the region on the ground where a humanoid must step to in order to come to a complete stop. The intersection between the capture region and the base of support determines which strategy the robot should adopt to successfully stop in a given situation. Computing the capture region for a humanoid, in general, is very difficult. However, with simple models of walking, computation of the capture region is simplified. We extend the well-known linear inverted pendulum model to include a flywheel body and show how to compute exact solutions of the capture region for this model. Adding rotational inertia enables the humanoid to control its centroidal angular momentum, much like the way human beings do, significantly enlarging the capture region. We present simulations of a simple planar biped that can recover balance after a push by stepping to the capture region and using internal angular momentum. Ongoing work involves applying the solution from the simple model as an approximate solution to more complex simulations of bipedal walking, including a 3D biped with distributed mass.},

For instance, legged robots with high payload capacity can be used in disaster scenarios to remove dangerous material or carry injured people. It is thus essential to develop planning algorithms that can enable complex robots to perform motion and manipulation tasks accurately. In addition, online adaptation mechanisms with respect to new, unknown environments are needed. In this work, we impose that the optimal state-input trajectories generated by Model Predictive Control (MPC) satisfy the Lyapunov function criterion derived in adaptive control for robotic systems. As a result, we combine the stability guarantees provided by Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and the optimality offered by MPC in a unified adaptive framework, yielding an improved performance during the robot's interaction with unknown objects. We validate the proposed approach in simulation and hardware tests on a quadrupedal robot carrying un-modeled payloads and pulling heavy boxes.},

abstract = {Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability provides formal guarantees for performance and safety properties of nonlinear control systems with bounded disturbances. Here, one aims to exactly compute the backward reachable set (BRS) or tube (BRT) -- the set of states from which the system can be driven into a target set at a particular time or within a time interval, respectively. The computational complexity of current approaches scales exponentially, making application to high-dimensional systems intractable. We propose a technique that decomposes the dynamics of a general class of nonlinear systems into subsystems which may be coupled through common states, controls, and disturbances. Despite this coupling, BRSs and BRTs can be computed efficiently and exactly using our technique without the need for linearizing dynamics or approximating sets as polytopes. Computations of BRSs and BRTs now become orders of magnitude faster, and for the first time BRSs and BRTs for many high-dimensional nonlinear control systems can be exactly computed. In situations where the exact solution cannot be computed, our proposed method can obtain slightly conservative results. We demonstrate our theory by numerically computing BRSs and BRTs for several systems, including the 6D Acrobatic Quadrotor and the 10D Near-Hover Quadrotor.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new control architecture for compliant motion control and safe physical interaction between humanoid robot and human. One of the key technologies in this framework is the torque transformer, which enables the implementation of joint torque control on the traditional joint position controlled robots. In this framework, the torque control is accomplished by converting desired joint torque command into instantaneous increments of joint velocity command. Through the transformer, the Operational Space Formulation was applied to account for the dynamics of the system on the current joint position controlled robots. This approach was experimentally implemented on the physical humanoid robot, HONDA ASIMO's upper body control. The ZMP based stable balance controller of ASIMO was integrated to control the lower body of the robot. In this framework, dynamics control by the torque transformer and stable position based balance controller were connected and coordinated together on the current position controlled humanoid robot. The paper presents modeling process of the torque transformer, whole body controller and the results of the implementation which demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.},

@article{Mason2017,
abstract = {In this work, we present an extension to a linear Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that plans external contact forces for the robot when given multiple contact locations and their corresponding friction cone. To accomplish this we set up a two step optimization problem. In the first optimization, we compute the Center of Mass (CoM) trajectory, foot step locations, and introduce slack variables to account for violating the imposed constraints on the Center of Pressure (CoP). We then use the slack variables to trigger the second optimization, in which we calculate the optimal external force that compensates for the CoP tracking error. This optimization considers multiple contacts with the environment by formulating the problem as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP) that can be solved at the order of 100 Hz. Once contact is created, the MIQP collapses to a single Quadratic Program (QP) that can be solved in real time $<$ 1kHz. Simulations show that the presented control scheme can withstand disturbances 2-5x larger with the additional force provide by a hand contact when considering delays and 3-6x larger when contact is already made.},

abstract = {The ability to anticipate a fall is fundamental for any robot that has to balance. Currently, fast fall-prediction algorithms only exist for simple models, such as the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM), whose validity breaks down in multicontact scenarios (i.e., when contacts are not limited to a flat ground). This paper presents a fast fall-prediction algorithm based on the point-mass model, which remains valid in multicontact scenarios. The key assumption of our algorithm is that, in order to come to a stop without changing its contacts, a robot only needs to accelerate its center of mass in the direction opposite to its velocity. This assumption allows us to predict the fall by means of a convex optimal control problem, which we solve with a fast custom algorithm (less than 11 ms of computation time). We validated the approach through extensive simulations with the humanoid robot HRP-2 in randomly-sampled scenarios. Comparisons with standard LIPM-based methods demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm in predicting the fall of the robot, when controlled with a state-of-the-art balance controller. This paper lays the foundations for the solution of the challenging problem of push recovery in multicontact scenarios.},

We propose a method for constructing safe, reliable reinforcement learning agents based on Lyapunov design principles. In our approach, an agent learns to control a system by switching among a number of given, base-level controllers. These controllers are designed using Lyapunov domain knowledge so that any switching policy is safe and enjoys basic performance guarantees. Our approach thus ensures qualitatively satisfactory agent behavior for virtually any reinforcement learning algorithm and at all times, including while the agent is learning and taking exploratory actions. We demonstrate the process of designing safe agents for four different control problems. In simulation experiments, we find that our theoretically motivated designs also enjoy a number of practical benefits, including reasonable performance initially and throughout learning, and accelerated learning.},

abstract = {In whole-body control, joint torques and external forces need to be estimated accurately. In principle, this can be done through pervasive joint-torque sensing and accurate system identification. However, these sensors are expensive and may not be integrated in all links. Moreover, the exact position of the contact must be known for a precise estimation. If contacts occur on the whole body, tactile sensors can estimate the contact location, but this requires a kinematic spatial calibration, which is prone to errors. Accumulating errors may have dramatic effects on the system identification. As an alternative to classical model-based approaches we propose a data-driven mixture-of-experts learning approach using Gaussian processes. This model predicts joint torques directly from raw data of tactile and force/torque sensors. We compare our approach to an analytic model-based approach on real world data recorded from the humanoid iCub. We show that the learned model accurately predicts the joint torques resulting from contact forces, is robust to changes in the environment and outperforms existing dynamic models that use of force/ torque sensor data.},

The software handles real and complex matrices and provides specific routines for symmetric and Hermitian matrices. The computation of matrix exponentials is a numerical issue of critical importance in the area of Markov chains and furthermore, the computed solution is subject to probabilistic constraints. In addition to addressing general matrix exponentials, a distinct attention is assigned to the computation of transient states of Markov chains.},

abstract = {— In the legged robotics control literature, feedback linearization is mostly used till date, along with computed torque, variable structure control, optimal and adaptive control. The biped robot control locomotion in general addresses the following three problems. Firstly, the reference trajectory is planned based on the stability analysis of the robot (ZMP/FRI). Then it is desirable to obtain a minimum jerk humanistic movement. Moreover the robot actuators have obvious physical limitations which need to be overcome. It is interesting to note that the above pattern of problem formulation naturally fits into the MPC framework. This work explores the existing void in this direction. One of the advantages of MPC is also that robust control ideas can be easily incorporated. A non-linear MIMO dynamical system of a three link biped robot with rigid, point feet would be considered as proof of concept.},

The integration of a kinematic controller and a torque controller for the dynamic model of a nonholonomic mobile robot has been presented (Fierro and Lewis, 1995). In this paper, an adaptive extension of the controller is proposed. If an adaptive tracking controller for the kinematic model with unknown parameters exists, an adaptive tracking controller for the dynamic model with unknown parameters can be designed by using an adaptive backstepping approach. A design example for a mobile robot with two actuated wheels is provided. In this design, a new kinematic adaptive controller is proposed, then a torque adaptive controller is derived by using the kinematic controller},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to answer (i) how the stabilization performance of a biped controller can be evaluated on a certain invariant supporting region, (ii) how the standing stabilizer which performs the best on a given supporting region can be designed, (iii) how the system can be judged if it is stabilizable by the best standing stabilizer without deforming the current supporting region, and (iv) how the supporting region should be deformed if it is judged to be necessary. In order to answer these question, the stable standing region is defined. It gives a criterion to design the best standing stabilizer, to judge if the deformation of the supporting region is necessary to stabilize the system, and to maneuver the stepping motion in accordance with the standing stabilizability condition, which is also defined in the paper. It is found that the best standing stabilizer can be designed by a simple pole-assignment technique. This framework unifies the standing stability and the stepping stability of bipedalism, which have been separately considered in conventional studies. The discussion goes on an approximate planar COM-ZMP model, in which the total mass is concentrated at the center of mass, and the position of ZMP is regarded as the input. Though it is the simplest dynamical model of bipeds, it can conceal differences of body constitutions and represent the macroscopic dynamics. Therefore, this paper contributes to not only the biped robot controller design but also the biomechanical analyses.},

abstract = {—Traditional motion planning approaches for multi-legged locomotion divide the problem into several stages, such as contact search and trajectory generation. However, reasoning about contacts and motions simultaneously is crucial for the generation of complex whole-body behaviors. Currently, coupling theses problems has required either the assumption of a fixed gait sequence and flat terrain condition, or non-convex optimization with intractable computation time. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer convex formulation to plan simultaneously contact locations, gait transitions and motion, in a computationally effi-cient fashion. In contrast to previous works, our approach is not limited to flat terrain nor to a pre-specified gait sequence. Instead, we incorporate the friction cone stability margin, approximate the robot's torque limits, and plan the gait using mixed-integer convex constraints. We experimentally validated our approach on the HyQ robot by traversing different challenging terrains, where non-convexity and flat terrain assumptions might lead to sub-optimal or unstable plans. Our method increases the motion robustness while keeping a low computation time.},

abstract = {Although fall is a rare event in the life of a humanoid robot, we must be prepared for it because its consequences are serious. In this paper we present a fall strategy which rapidly modifies the robot's fall direction in order to avoid hitting a person or an object in the vicinity. Our approach is based on the key observation that during &#x201C;toppling&#x201D; the rotational motion of a robot necessarily occurs at the leading edge or the leading corner of its support base polygon. To modify the fall direction the robot needs to change the position and orientation of this edge or corner vis-a-vis the prohibited direction. We achieve it through intelligent stepping as soon as a fall is detected. We compute the optimal stepping location which results in the safest fall. Additional improvement to the fall controller is achieved through inertia shaping techniques aimed at controlling the centroidal inertia of the robot. We demonstrate our results through the simulation of an Asimo-like humanoid robot. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a controller that attempts to change the fall direction of a humanoid robot.},

abstract = {Variable Impedance Actuators (VIA) have received increasing attention in recent years as many novel applications involving interactions with an unknown and dynamic environment including humans require actuators with dynamics that are not well-achieved by classical stiff actuators. This paper presents an overview of the different VIAs developed and proposes a classification based on the principles through which the variable stiffness and damping are achieved. The main classes are active impedance by control, inherent compliance and damping actuators, inertial actuators, and combinations of them, which are then further divided into subclasses. This classification allows for designers of new devices to orientate and take inspiration and users of VIA's to be guided in the design and implementation process for their targeted application. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

WALKING
Walking is created by sequencing four movements: (1) shifting the robot's weight to the right foot, (2) swinging the right foot forward, (3) shifting the weight back to the left foot, and (4) swinging the left foot forward.
Task Feasibility:
When the condition number of the foot grows beyond normal values we command the foot to step back within the reachable workspace to gain stability.

abstract = {Many state-of-the-art approaches to trajectory optimization and optimal control are intimately related to standard Newton methods. For researchers that work in the inter- sections of machine learning, robotics, control, and optimization, such relations are highly relevant but sometimes hard to see across disciplines, due also to the different notations and conventions used in the disciplines. The aim of this tutorial is to introduce to constrained trajectory optimization in a manner that allows us to establish these relations. We consider a basic but general formalization of the problem and discuss the structure of Newton steps in this setting. The computation of Newton steps can then be related to dynamic programming, establishing relations to DDP, iLQG, and AICO. We can also clarify how inverting a banded symmetric matrix is related to dynamic programming as well as message passing in Markov chains and factor graphs. Further, for a machine learner, path optimization and Gaussian Pro- cesses seem intuitively related problems. We establish such a relation and show how to solve a Gaussian Process-regularized path optimization problem efficiently. Further topics include how to derive an optimal controller around the path, model predictive control in constrained k-order control processes, and the pullback metric interpretation of the Gauss-Newton ap- proximation.},

Loco-manipulation planning is a key technological brick enabling humanoid robots to autonomously perform object transportation by manipulating them. We formulate planning of the alternation and sequencing of footsteps and grasps as a graph search problem with a new transition model that allows for a flexible representation of loco-manipulation. Our transition model is quickly evaluated by relocating and switching the reachability maps depending on the motion of both the robot and object. We evaluate our approach by applying it to loco-manipulation use-cases, such as a bobbin rolling operation with regrasping, where the motion is automatically planned by our framework.},

abstract = {We present VILENS (Visual Inertial Lidar Legged Navigation System), an odometry system for legged robots based on factor graphs. The key novelty is the tight fusion of four different sensor modalities to achieve reliable operation when the individual sensors would otherwise produce degenerate estimation. To minimize leg odometry drift, we extend the robot's state with a linear velocity bias term which is estimated online. This bias is only observable because of the tight fusion of this preintegrated velocity factor with vision, lidar, and IMU factors. Extensive experimental validation on the ANYmal quadruped robots is presented, for a total duration of 2 h and 1.8 km traveled. The experiments involved dynamic locomotion over loose rocks, slopes, and mud; these included perceptual challenges, such as dark and dusty underground caverns or open, feature-deprived areas, as well as mobility challenges such as slipping and terrain deformation. We show an average improvement of 62% translational and 51% rotational errors compared to a state-of-the-art loosely coupled approach. To demonstrate its robustness, VILENS was also integrated with a perceptive controller and a local path planner.},

abstract = {This paper presents a Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework for trajectory optimization (TO) of hybrid systems with state-based switching. The proposed Hybrid-Systems DDP (HS-DDP) approach is considered for application to whole-body motion planning with legged robots. Specifically, HS-DDP incorporates three algorithmic advances: an impact-aware DDP step addressing the impact event in legged locomotion, an Augmented Lagrangian (AL) method dealing with the switching constraint, and a Switching Time Optimization (STO) algorithm that optimizes switching times by leveraging the structure of DDP. Further, a Relaxed Barrier (ReB) method is used to manage inequality constraints and is integrated into HS-DDP for locomotion planning. The performance of the developed algorithms is benchmarked on a simulation model of the MIT Mini Cheetah executing a bounding gait. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AL and ReB for switching constraints, friction constraints, and torque limits. By comparing to previous solutions, we show that the STO algorithm achieves 2.3 times more reduction of total switching times, demonstrating the efficiency of our method.},

In this paper, we extend our previously proposed Intrinsically Stable MPC (IS-MPC) method, which guarantees stable tracking for the unperturbed case, to the case of persistent disturbances. This is achieved by designing a disturbance observer whose estimate is used to set up a modified stability constraint for the QP problem. The method is validated by MATLAB tests as well as dynamic simulations for a NAO humanoid in DART.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives when interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning. Their discussion ranges from the history of the field's intellectual foundations to the most recent developments and applications. The only necessary mathematical background is familiarity with elementary concepts of probability. The book is divided into three parts. Part I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. Part II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning. Part III presents a unified view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks, eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case studies and consider the future of reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first successful experiment implementing whole-body model predictive control with state feedback on a torque-control humanoid robot. We demonstrate that our control scheme is able to do whole-body target tracking, control the balance in front of strong external perturbations and avoid collision with an external object. The key elements for this success are threefold. First, optimal control over a receding horizon is implemented with Crocoddyl, an optimal control library based on differential dynamics programming, providing state-feedback control in less than 10 msecs. Second, a warm start strategy based on memory of motion has been implemented to overcome the sensitivity of the optimal control solver to initial conditions. Finally, the optimal trajectories are executed by a low-level torque controller, feedbacking on direct torque measurement at high frequency. This paper provides the details of the method, along with analytical benchmarks with the real humanoid robot Talos.

Our central contribution is to demonstrate how the Hamiltonian structure of rigid-body dynamics can be exploited to establish approximate simulation for a high-dimensional nonlinear system. The resulting controller is passive, more robust to push disturbances, uneven terrain, and modeling errors than standard QP-based methods, and naturally enables high center of mass walking. Our theoretical results are supported by simulation experiments with a 30 degree-of-freedom Valkyrie humanoid model.},

abstract = {In this letter, we propose a graph-search based multi-contact locomotion planning method for humanoid robots, focusing on the sustainability of contacts as its key feature. We introduce the idea of sustainable contact area, which represents the area on which contacts can be maintained during contact transitions. This enables us to select feasible contact candidates along a given root path. Then, we compute all the possible combinations of these candidate contacts with every limb appearing at most once, which we call contact sets. The list of these contact sets can be regarded as a list of nodes in a graph structure representing transitions between sustainable contacts, which we name as the sustainable contact graph. We apply A∗ search on this graph, and evaluate the connectability of nodes by planning quasi-static motion sequences for their contact transitions. In this process, we locally modify the candidate contact to satisfy kinematics constraints and static equilibrium of the robot. The proposed method enables us to plan feasible contact transition motions without random sampling or manually designed contact transition models, and solves the problem of ignoring possible contact transitions, which is caused by the discretization in existing graph-search based planners. We evaluate our proposed method in both simulation and a real robot, and confirm that it contributes to improving the multi-contact locomotion abilities of a humanoid robot.},

Given the probability distributions of the disturbance input, the measurement noise and the initial state estimation error, the distributions of future realizations of the constrained variables are predicted using the dynamics of the plant and a linear state estimator. From these distributions, a set of deterministic constraints is computed for the predictions of a nominal model. The constraints are incorporated in a receding horizon optimization of an expected quadratic cost, which is formulated as a quadratic program. The constraints are constructed so as to provide a guarantee of recursive feasibility, and the closed loop system is stable in a mean-square sense.

As calculating Lipschitz constants is NP-hard, techniques for estimating Lipschitz constants must navigate the trade-off between scalability and accuracy. In this work, we significantly push the scalability frontier of a semidefinite programming technique known as LipSDP while achieving zero accuracy loss. We first show that LipSDP has chordal sparsity, which allows us to derive a chordally sparse formulation that we call Chordal-LipSDP. The key benefit is that the main computational bottleneck of LipSDP, a large semidefinite constraint, is now decomposed into an equivalent collection of smaller ones: allowing Chordal-LipSDP to outperform LipSDP particularly as the network depth grows. Moreover, our formulation uses a tunable sparsity parameter that enables one to gain tighter estimates without incurring a significant computational cost. We illustrate the scalability of our approach through extensive numerical experiments.},

abstract = {Purpose – The paper seeks to present a new generation of torque-controlled light-weight robots (LWR) developed at the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics of the German Aerospace Center. Design/methodology/approach – An integrated mechatronic design approach for LWR is presented. Owing to the partially unknown properties of the environment, robustness of planning and control with respect to environmental variations is crucial. Robustness is achieved in this context through sensor redundancy and passivity-based control. In the DLR root concept, joint torque sensing plays a central role. Findings – In order to act in unstructured environments and interact with humans, the robots have design features and control/software functionalities which distinguish them from classical robots, such as: load-to-weight ratio of 1:1, torque sensing in the joints, active vibration damping, sensitive collision detection, compliant control on joint and Cartesian level. Practical implications – The DLR robots are excellent research platforms for experimentation of advanced robotics algorithms. Space and medical robotics are further areas for which these robots were designed and hopefully will be applied within the next years. Potential industrial application fields are the fast automatic assembly as well as manufacturing activities done in cooperation with humans (industrial robot assistant). The described functionalities are of course highly relevant also for the potentially huge market of service robotics. The LWR technology was transferred to KUKA Roboter GmbH, which will bring the first arms on the market in the near future. Originality/value – This paper introduces a new type of LWR with torque sensing in each joint and describes a consistent approach for using these sensors for manipulation in human environments. To the best of one's knowledge, the first systematic experimental evaluation of possible injuries during robot-human crashes using standardized testing facilities is presented.},

The sparse structure of the resulting Karush-Kuhn-Tucker linear system in the QP formulation is exploited, and sparse direct methods are utilized to solve the linear system of equations. To further accelerate the factorization process, we only modify the corresponding rows of the matrix factors that change during iterations and cache the nonzero Cholesky pattern. qpSWIFT is library free, written in ANSI-C and its performance is benchmarked through standard problems that could be cast as QP. Numerical results show that qpSWIFT outperforms state-of-the-art solvers for small scale problems.

abstract = {Shooting methods are an efficient approach to solving nonlinear optimal control problems. As they use local optimization, they exhibit favorable convergence when initialized with a good warm-start but may not converge at all if provided with a poor initial guess. Recent work has focused on providing an initial guess from a learned model trained on samples generated during an offline exploration of the problem space. However, in practice, the solutions contain discontinuities introduced by system dynamics or the environment. Additionally, in many cases, multiple equally suitable, i.e., multimodal, solutions exist to solve a problem. Classic learning approaches smooth across the boundary of these discontinuities and thus generalize poorly. In this work, we apply tools from algebraic topology to extract information on the underlying structure of the solution space. In particular, we introduce a method based on persistent homology to automatically cluster the dataset of precomputed solutions to obtain different candidate initial guesses. We then train a mixture-of-experts within each cluster to predict state and control trajectories to warm-start the optimal control solver and provide a comparison with modality-agnostic learning. We demonstrate our method on a cartpole toy problem and a quadrotor avoiding obstacles, and show that clustering samples based on inherent structure improves the warm-start quality.},

abstract = {Autonomous learning is one of the hallmarks of human and animal behavior, and understanding the principles of learning will be crucial in order to achieve true autonomy in advanced machines like humanoid robots. In this paper, we examine learning of complex motor skills with human-like limbs. While supervised learning can offer useful tools for bootstrapping behavior, e.g., by learning from demonstration, it is only reinforcement learning that offers a general approach to the final trial-and-error improvement that is needed by each individual acquiring a skill. Neither neurobiological nor machine learning studies have, so far, offered compelling results on how reinforcement learning can be scaled to the high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces of humans or humanoids. Here, we combine two recent research developments on learning motor control in order to achieve this scaling. First, we interpret the idea of modular motor control by means of motor primitives as a suitable way to generate parameterized control policies for reinforcement learning. Second, we combine motor primitives with the theory of stochastic policy gradient learning, which currently seems to be the only feasible framework for reinforcement learning for humanoids. We evaluate different policy gradient methods with a focus on their applicability to parameterized motor primitives. We compare these algorithms in the context of motor primitive learning, and show that our most modern algorithm, the Episodic Natural Actor-Critic outperforms previous algorithms by at least an order of magnitude. We demonstrate the efficiency of this reinforcement learning method in the application of learning to hit a baseball with an anthropomorphic robot arm.},

@article{Mobahi2015,
abstract = {The continuation method is a popular heuristic in computer vision for nonconvex optimization. The idea is to start from a simplified problem and gradually deform it to the actual task while tracking the solution. It was first used in computer vision under the name of graduated nonconvexity. Since then, it has been utilized explicitly or implicitly in various applications. In fact, state-of-the-art optical flow and shape estimation rely on a form of continuation. Despite its empirical success, there is little theoretical understanding of this method. This work provides some novel insights into this technique. Specifically, there are many ways to choose the initial problem and many ways to progressively deform it to the original task. However, here we show that when this process is constructed by Gaussian smoothing, it is optimal in a specific sense. In fact, we prove that Gaussian smoothing emerges from the best affine approximation to Vese's nonlinear PDE. The latter PDE evolves any function to its convex envelope, hence providing the optimal convexification.},

@article{Mayne2000,
abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

abstract = {We consider problems of sequential robot manipulation (aka. combined task and motion planning) where the objective is primarily given in terms of a cost function over the final geometric state, rather than a symbolic goal description. In this case we should leverage optimization methods to inform search over potential action sequences. We propose to formulate the problem holistically as a 1st-order logic extension of a mathematical program: a non-linear constrained program over the full world trajectory where the symbolic state-action sequence defines the (in-)equality constraints. We tackle the challenge of solving such programs by proposing three levels of approximation: The coarsest level introduces the concept of the effective end state kinematics, parametrically describing all possible end state configurations conditional to a given symbolic action sequence. Optimization on this level is fast and can inform symbolic search. The other two levels optimize over interaction keyframes and eventually over the full world trajectory across interactions. We demonstrate the approach on a problem of maximizing the height of a physically stable construction from an assortment of boards, cylinders and blocks.},

The considered disturbance signals vary in a range of known amplitude around a mid-range value that can change at each sampling time, but whose current value is assumed to be available. The method consists in modifying the stability constraint that is at the core of IS-MPC by incorporating the current mid-range disturbance, and performing an appropriate restriction of the ZMP constraint in the control horizon on the basis of the range amplitude of the disturbance. We derive explicit conditions for recursive feasibility and internal stability of the IS-MPC method with constraint modification.

We construct a probabilistic line search by combining the structure of existing deterministic methods with notions from Bayesian optimization. Our method retains a Gaussian process surrogate of the univariate optimization objective, and uses a probabilistic belief over the Wolfe conditions to monitor the descent. The algorithm has very low computational cost, and no user-controlled parameters. Experiments show that it effectively removes the need to define a learning rate for stochastic gradient descent.},

A tensor-free approach to DDP is developed where all the necessary derivatives are computed with the same complexity as in the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator$\sim$(iLQR). Compared to linearized models used in iLQR, DDP more accurately represents the dynamics locally, but it is not often used since the second-order derivatives of the dynamics are tensorial and expensive to compute. This work shows how to avoid the need for computing the derivative tensor by instead leveraging reverse-mode accumulation of derivative information to compute a key vector-tensor product directly. We benchmark this approach for trajectory optimization with multi-link manipulators and show that the benefits of DDP can often be included without sacrificing evaluation time, and can be done in fewer iterations than iLQR.},

The adaptive controller consists of adaptive frequency oscillators in different configurations and produces dynamic gaits such as bounding and jumping. We show two main results: (1) The adaptive controller is able to track the resonant frequency of the robot which is a function of different body parameters (2) controllers based on dynamical systems as we present are able to “recognize” mechanically intrinsic modes of locomotion, adapt to them and enforce them. More specifically the main results are supported by several experiments, showing first that the adaptive controller is constantly tracking body properties and readjusting to them. Second, that important gait parameters are dependent on the geometry and movement of the robot and the controller can account for that. Third, that local control is sufficient and the adaptive controller can adapt to the different mechanical modes. And finally, that key properties of the gaits are not only depending on properties of the body but also the actual mode of movement that the body is operating in. We show that even if we specify the gait pattern on the level of the CPG the chosen gait pattern does not necessarily correspond to the CPG's pattern. Furthermore, we present the analytical treatment of adaptive frequency oscillators in closed feedback loops, and compare the results to the data from the robot experiments.},

abstract = {It is a matter of fact that the derivative action is seldom adopted in practical cases (actually, 80% of the employed PID controllers have the derivative part switched-off (Ang et al., 2005)), although it has been shown that it is pos- sible to provide a significant improvement of the control performance (note that this improvement becomes less important as the ratio between the ap- parent time delay and the effective time constant increases (Kristiansson and Lennartson, 2006; ˚ Astr¨ om and H¨ agglund, 2004)). This is due to a number of reasons, one of them being certainly that it is the most difficult to tune, as explained in Section 1.9. Indeed, the stability regions for PID controllers are more complex than those for PI controllers and therefore the tuning of a PID controller is more difficult (˚ Astr¨ om and H¨ agglund, 2000b). Also, the inherent amplification of the measurement noise represents a significant technological problem, because, if not properly filtered, it might cause a damage to the actuator. In this chapter it is shown that part of the problem is due also to the structure of the PID controller (see (1.20)–(1.24)), in particular if a PID controller in ideal form with a fixed derivative filter parameter N is adopted.},

abstract = {This paper considers the analysis of continuous time gradient-based optimization algorithms through the lens of nonlinear contraction theory. It demonstrates that in the case of a timeinvariant objective, most elementary results on gradient descent based on convexity can be replaced by much more general results based on contraction. In particular, gradient descent converges to a unique equilibrium if its dynamics are contracting in any metric, with convexity of the cost corresponding to the special case of contraction in the identity metric. More broadly, contraction analysis provides new insights for the case of geodesically-convex optimization, wherein non-convex problems in Euclidean space can be transformed to convex ones posed over a Riemannian manifold. In this case, natural gradient descent converges to a unique equilibrium if it is contracting in any metric, with geodesic convexity of the cost corresponding to contraction in the natural metric. New results using semi-contraction provide additional insights into the topology of the set of optimizers in the case when multiple optima exist. Furthermore, they show how semi-contraction may be combined with specific additional information to reach broad conclusions about a dynamical system. The contraction perspective also easily extends to time-varying optimization settings and allows one to recursively build large optimization structures out of simpler elements. Extensions to natural primal-dual optimization and game-theoretic contexts further illustrate the potential reach of these new perspectives.},

In this paper we present the first real-time realization of a unified NMPC and CLF controller on a robotic system with limited computational resources. These limitations motivate a set of approaches for efficiently incorporating CLF stability constraints into a general NMPC formulation. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods compared to baseline CLF and NMPC controllers with a robotic Segway platform both in simulation and on hardware. The addition of a prediction horizon provides a performance advantage over CLF based controllers, which operate optimally point-wise in time. Moreover, the explicitly imposed stability constraints remove the need for difficult cost function and parameter tuning required by NMPC. Therefore the unified controller improves the performance of each isolated controller and simplifies the overall design process.},

@article{Faraji2018,
abstract = {We present a new walking foot-placement controller based on 3LP, a 3D model of bipedal walking that is composed of three pendulums to simulate falling, swing and torso dynamics. Taking advantage of linear equations and closed-form solutions of the 3LP model, our proposed controller projects intermediate states of the biped back to the beginning of the phase for which a discrete LQR controller is designed. After the projection, a proper control policy is generated by this LQR controller and used at the intermediate time. This control paradigm reacts to disturbances immediately and includes rules to account for swing dynamics and leg-retraction. We apply it to a simulated Atlas robot in position-control, always commanded to perform in-place walking. The stance hip joint in our robot keeps the torso upright to let the robot naturally fall, and the swing hip joint tracks the desired footstep location. Combined with simple Center of Pressure (CoP) damping rules in the low-level controller, our foot-placement enables the robot to recover from strong pushes and produce periodic walking gaits when subject to persistent sources of disturbance, externally or internally. These gaits are imprecise, i.e., emergent from asymmetry sources rather than precisely imposing a desired velocity to the robot. Also in extreme conditions, restricting linearity assumptions of the 3LP model are often violated, but the system remains robust in our simulations. An extensive analysis of closed-loop eigenvalues, viable regions and sensitivity to push timings further demonstrate the strengths of our simple controller.},

Most works in optimal control focus on finding a single optimal trajectory, which is then typically tracked by another controller. In this work, we instead consider trajectory distribution as the solution of an optimal control problem, resulting in better tracking performance and a more stable controller. A Gaussian distribution is first obtained from an iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) solver. A short horizon Model Predictive Control (MPC) is then used to track this distribution. We show that tracking a distribution is more cost-efficient and robust as compared to tracking the mean or using iLQR feedback control. The proposed method is validated with kinematic control of 7-DoF Panda manipulator and dynamic control of 6-DoF quadcopter in simulation.},

abstract = {This paper discusses a novel probabilistic approach for the design of robust model predictive control (MPC) laws for discrete-time linear systems affected by parametric uncertainty and additive disturbances. The proposed technique is based on the iterated solution, at each step, of a finite-horizon optimal control problem (FHOCP) that takes into account a suitable number of randomly extracted scenarios of uncertainty and disturbances, followed by a specific command selection rule implemented in a receding horizon fashion. The scenario FHOCP is always convex, also when the uncertain parameters and disturbance belong to nonconvex sets, and irrespective of how the model uncertainty influences the system's matrices. Moreover, the computational complexity of the proposed approach does not depend on the uncertainty/disturbance dimensions, and scales quadratically with the control horizon. The main result in this work is related to the analysis of the closed loop system under receding-horizon implementation of the scenario FHOCP, and essentially states that the devised control law guarantees constraint satisfaction at each step with some a priori assigned probability p, while the system's state reaches the target set either asymptotically, or in finite time with probability at least p. The proposed method may be a valid alternative when other existing techniques, either deterministic or stochastic, are not directly usable due to excessive conservatism or to numerical intractability caused by lack of convexity of the robust or chance-constrained optimization problem.},

abstract = {We propose a method for checking and enforcing multi-contact stability based on the zero-moment point (ZMP). Our first contribution is to characterize and provide a fast computation algorithm for ZMP support areas in arbitrary virtual planes. Contrary to previous works, our support areas also account for frictional constraints. We then select a ZMP plane above the center of mass of the robot, which turns the usual (unstable) control law of a linear inverted pendulum into that of a (marginally stable) linear pendulum (LP). We next observe that pendular models involve a regulation of the dynamic momentum, which in turn shrinks the support area of the ZMP. Our second contribution is a new algorithm to compute ZMP support areas under both frictional and dynamic-momentum constraints. We show that, under an LP control law, the support areas thus constructed are a necessary and sufficient condition for contact stability. Based on these developments, we implement a whole-body controller and generate dynamically-stable motions where an HRP-4 humanoid locomotes in challenging simulation environments.},

abstract = {Iterative trajectory optimization techniques for non-linear dynamical systems are among the most powerful and sample-efficient methods of model-based reinforcement learning and approximate optimal control. By leveraging time-variant local linear-quadratic approximations of system dynamics and reward, such methods can find both a target-optimal trajectory and time-variant optimal feedback controllers. However, the local linear-quadratic assumptions are a major source of optimization bias that leads to catastrophic greedy updates, raising the issue of proper regularization. Moreover, the approximate models' disregard for any physical state-action limits of the system causes further aggravation of the problem, as the optimization moves towards unreachable areas of the state-action space. In this paper, we address the issue of constrained systems in the scenario of online-fitted stochastic linear dynamics. We propose modeling state and action physical limits as probabilistic chance constraints linear in both state and action and introduce a new trajectory optimization technique that integrates these probabilistic constraints by optimizing a relaxed quadratic program. Our empirical evaluations show a significant improvement in learning robustness, which enables our approach to perform more effective updates and avoid premature convergence observed in state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {We present parametric trajectory optimization, a method for simultaneously computing physical parameters, actuation requirements, and robot motions for more efficient robot designs. In this scheme, robot dimensions, masses, and other physical parameters are solved for concurrently with traditional motion planning variables, including dynamically consistent robot states, actuation inputs, and contact forces. Our method requires minimal user domain knowledge, requiring only a coarse guess of the target robot configuration sequence and a parameterized robot topology as input. We demonstrate our results on four simulated robots, one of which we physically fabricated in order to demonstrate physical consistency. We demonstrate that by optimizing robot body parameters alongside robot trajectories, motion planning problems which would otherwise be infeasible can be made feasible, and actuation requirements can be significantly reduced.},

abstract = {Dynamic platforms that operate over many unique terrain conditions typically require many behaviours. To transition safely, there must be an overlap of states between adjacent controllers. We develop a novel method for training setup policies that bridge the trajectories between pre-trained Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policies. We demonstrate our method with a simulated biped traversing a difficult jump terrain, where a single policy fails to learn the task, and switching between pre-trained policies without setup policies also fails. We perform an ablation of key components of our system, and show that our method outperforms others that learn transition policies. We demonstrate our method with several difficult and diverse terrain types, and show that we can use setup policies as part of a modular control suite to successfully traverse a sequence of complex terrains. We show that using setup policies improves the success rate for traversing a single difficult jump terrain (from 51.3$\%$ success rate with the best comparative method to 82.2$\%$), and traversing a random sequence of difficult obstacles (from 1.9$\%$ without setup policies to 71.2$\%$).},

abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is a popular control method that has proved effective for robotics, among other fields. MPC performs re-planning at every time step. Re-planning is done with a limited horizon per computational and real-time constraints and often also for robustness to potential model errors. However, the limited horizon leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we consider the iterative learning setting, where the same task can be repeated several times, and propose a policy improvement scheme for MPC. The main idea is that between executions we can, offline, run MPC with a longer horizon, resulting in a hindsight plan. To bring the next real-world execution closer to the hindsight plan, our approach learns to re-shape the original cost function with the goal of satisfying the following property: short horizon planning (as realistic during real executions) with respect to the shaped cost should result in mimicking the hindsight plan. This effectively consolidates long-term reasoning into the short-horizon planning. We empirically evaluate our approach in contact-rich manipulation tasks both in simulated and real environments, such as peg insertion by a real PR2 robot.},

abstract = {Noise-corrupted signals and images can be reconstructed by regularization. If discontinuities must be preserved in the reconstruction, a non-convex solution space is implied. The solution of minimum energy can be approximated by the Graduated Non-Convexity (GNC) algorithm. The GNC approximates the non-convex solution space by a convex solution space, and varies the solution space slowly towards the non-convex solution space. This work provides a method of finding the convex approximation to the solution space, and the convergent series of solution spaces. The same methodology can be used on a wide range of regularization schemes. The approximation of the solution space is carried out by a scale space extension of the smoothness measure, in which a coarse-to-fine analysis can be performed. It is proven, that this scale space extension yields a convex solution space. GNC by smoothness focusing is tested against the Blake-Zisserman formulation and is shown to yield better results in most cases. Furthermore, is it pointed out that Mean Field Annealing (MFA) of the weak string does not necessarily imply GNC, but behaves in a predictable and inexpedient manner.},

Examples of the application of the methods to the Taylor polynomial approximation of matrix functions like the matrix exponential and matrix cosine are given. Their efficiency is compared with that of the best existing evaluation schemes for general polynomial and rational approximations, and also with a recent method based on mixed rational and polynomial approximants. For many years, the Paterson–Stockmeyer method has been considered the most efficient general method for the evaluation of matrix polynomials. In this paper we show that this statement is no longer true. Moreover, for many years rational approximations have been considered more efficient than polynomial approximations, although recently it has been shown that often this is not the case in the computation of the matrix exponential and matrix cosine. In this paper we show that in fact polynomial approximations provide a higher order of approximation than the state-of-the-art computational methods for rational approximations for the same cost in terms of matrix products.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Institution of Mechanical Engineers. The purpose of this paper is to present a virtual passive actuator which enables the manipulator joint to behave as a desired spring-damper system. When the manipulator interacts with an unknown environment or human operator, huge contact force will be generated with a high-stiffness trajectory tracking controller: to avoid violent collisions, the virtual passive actuator is proposed to diminish the interaction force, and adjust the system stiffness to adapt to the environment. With the mathematical model of the virtual passive actuator, the system's stable region is determined based on the Routh-Hurwitz criterion. The influence of operation time delay, filter and model uncertainty is taken into consideration. Finally, the virtual passive actuator is incorporated into a manipulator, and validity is verified through a set of experiments. Experiment results show that, with the proposed controller, virtual passive actuator joint deformation is proportional to the external torque, and the proportional ratio is close to the stiffness setting: it can perform dynamic behavior just like a spring-damper system when subject to step external torque.},

When does this capacity for crossmodal integration develop? Here, we show that prior to 8 years of age, integration of visual and haptic spatial information is far from optimal, with either vision or touch dominating totally, even in conditions in which the dominant sense is far less precise than the other (assessed by discrimination thresholds). For size discrimination, haptic information dominates in determining both perceived size and discrimination thresholds, whereas for orientation discrimination, vision dominates. By 8-10 years, the integration becomes statistically optimal, like adults. We suggest that during development, perceptual systems require constant recalibration, for which cross-sensory comparison is important. Using one sense to calibrate the other precludes useful combination of the two sources.},

abstract = {Humanoid robots are inherently unstable because their center of mass is high, compared to the support polygon's size. Bipedal walking currently works well only under controlled conditions with limited external disturbances. In less controlled dynamic environments, such as RoboCup soccer fields, external disturbances might be large. While some disturbances might be too large to prevent a fall, some disturbances can be dealt with by specific rescue behaviors. This paper proposes a method to detect instabilities that occur during omnidirectional walking. We model the readings of attitude sensors using sinusoids. The model takes the gait target vector into account. We estimate model parameters from a gait test sequence and detect deviations of the actual sensor readings from the model later on. These deviations are aggregated to an instability indicator that triggers one of two reflexes, based on indicator strength. For small instabilities the robot is slowing down, but continues walking. For stronger instabilities the robot stops and is brought into a stable posture with a low center of mass. Walking continues as soon as the instability disappears. We extensively evaluated our approach in simulation by disturbing the robot with a variety of impulses. The results indicate that our method is very effective. For smaller disturbances, the probability of a fall could be reduced to zero. Most of the medium-sized disturbances could also be rejected. For the evaluation with the real robot, we used a walking against a wall with different speeds and at various angles. Here the results show a similar outcome to the ones in the simulations},

It is showed that if the solution satisfies the second-order sufficient conditions of the OCP with the transformed mixed state-control constraints, it is a local minimum of the OCP with the original pure-state constraints. A Riccati recursion algorithm is derived to solve the OCP using the transformed constraints with linear time complexity in the grid number of the horizon, in contrast to a previous approach that scales cubically with respect to the total dimension of the pure-state equality constraints. Numerical experiments on the whole-body optimal control of quadrupedal gaits that involve pure-state equality constraints owing to contact switches demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing approaches.},

abstract = {In this paper we develop a novel, discrete-time optimal control framework for mechanical systems with uncertain model parameters. We consider finite-horizon problems where the performance index depends on the statistical moments of the stochastic system. Our approach constitutes an extension of the original Differential Dynamic Programming method and handles uncertainty through generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) theory. The developed iterative scheme is capable of controlling the probabilistic evolution of the dynamic system and can be used in planning and control. Moreover, its scalable and fast converging nature play a key role when dealing with complex, high-dimensional problems. Based on Lagrangian mechanics principles, we also prove that Variational Integrators can be designed to properly propagate and linearize the gPC representations of stochastic, forced mechanical systems in discrete time. We utilize this benefit to further improve the efficiency of our trajectory-optimization methodology. Numerical simulations are included to validate the applicability of our approach.},

@inproceedings{Manchester,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 The Authors. Fluvial deposits can provide excellent archives of early hominin activity but may be complex to interpret, especially without extensive geochronology. The Stone Age site of Kalambo Falls, northern Zambia, has yielded a rich artefact record from dominantly fluvial deposits, but its significance has been restricted by uncertainties over site formation processes and a limited chronology. Our new investigations in the centre of the Kalambo Basin have used luminescence to provide a chronology and have provided key insights into the geomorphological and sedimentological processes involved in site formation. Excavations reveal a complex assemblage of channel and floodplain deposits. Single grain quartz optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) measurements provide the most accurate age estimates for the youngest sediments, but in older deposits the OSL signal from some grains is saturated. A different luminescence signal from quartz, thermally transferred OSL (TT-OSL), can date these older deposits. OSL and TT-OSL results are combined to provide a chronology for the site. Ages indicate four phases of punctuated deposition by the dominantly laterally migrating and vertically aggrading Kalambo River ($\sim$500-300 ka, $\sim$300-50 ka, $\sim$50-30 ka, $\sim$1.5-0.49 ka), followed by deep incision and renewed lateral migration at a lower topographic level. A conceptual model for site formation provides the basis for improved interpretation of the generation, preservation, and visibility of the Kalambo archaeological record. This model highlights the important role of intrinsic meander dynamics in site formation and does not necessarily require complex interpretations that invoke periodic blocking of the Kalambo River, as has previously been suggested. The oldest luminescence ages place the Mode 2/3 transition between $\sim$500 and 300 ka, consistent with other African and Asian sites where a similar transition can be found. The study approach adopted here can potentially be applied to other fluvial Stone Age sites throughout Africa and beyond.},

In this paper, we present a new humanoid robot design, an actuator-aware kino-dynamic motion planner, and a landing controller as part of a practical system design for highly dynamic motion control of the humanoid robot. To achieve the impulsive motions, we develop two new proprioceptive actuators and experimentally evaluate their performance using our custom-designed dynamometer. The actuator's torque, velocity, and power limits are reflected in our kino-dynamic motion planner by approximating the configuration-dependent reaction force limits and in our dynamics simulator by including actuator dynamics along with the robot's full-body dynamics. For the landing control, we effectively integrate model-predictive control and whole-body impulse control by connecting them in a dynamically consistent way to accomplish both the long-time horizon optimal control and high-bandwidth full-body dynamics-based feedback. Actuators' torque output over the entire motion are validated based on the velocity-torque model including battery voltage droop and back-EMF voltage. With the carefully designed hardware and control framework, we successfully demonstrate dynamic behaviors such as back flips, front flips, and spinning jumps in our realistic dynamics simulation.},

abstract = {Animals have evolved various agile locomotion strategies, such as sprinting, leaping, and jumping. There is a growing interest in developing legged robots that move like their biological counterparts and show various agile skills to navigate complex environments quickly. Despite the interest, the field lacks systematic benchmarks to measure the performance of control policies and hardware in agility. We introduce the Barkour benchmark, an obstacle course to quantify agility for legged robots. Inspired by dog agility competitions, it consists of diverse obstacles and a time based scoring mechanism. This encourages researchers to develop controllers that not only move fast, but do so in a controllable and versatile way. To set strong baselines, we present two methods for tackling the benchmark. In the first approach, we train specialist locomotion skills using on-policy reinforcement learning methods and combine them with a high-level navigation controller. In the second approach, we distill the specialist skills into a Transformer-based generalist locomotion policy, named Locomotion-Transformer, that can handle various terrains and adjust the robot's gait based on the perceived environment and robot states. Using a custom-built quadruped robot, we demonstrate that our method can complete the course at half the speed of a dog. We hope that our work represents a step towards creating controllers that enable robots to reach animal-level agility.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel algorithm for the continuous control of dynamical systems that combines Trajectory Optimization (TO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a single framework. The motivations behind this algorithm are the two main limitations of TO and RL when applied to continuous nonlinear systems to minimize a non-convex cost function. Specifically, TO can get stuck in poor local minima when the search is not initialized close to a ``good'' minimum. On the other hand, when dealing with continuous state and control spaces, the RL training process may be excessively long and strongly dependent on the exploration strategy. Thus, our algorithm learns a ``good'' control policy via TO-guided RL policy search that, when used as initial guess provider for TO, makes the trajectory optimization process less prone to converge to poor local optima. Our method is validated on several reaching problems featuring non-convex obstacle avoidance with different dynamical systems, including a car model with 6d state, and a 3-joint planar manipulator. Our results show the great capabilities of CACTO in escaping local minima, while being more computationally efficient than the DDPG RL algorithm.},

To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images and independently of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. To train our network, we collected over 800,000 grasp attempts over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and hardware. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing.},

abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently impressed the world with stunning results in various applications. While the potential of RL is now well-established, many critical aspects still need to be tackled, including safety and stability issues. These issues, while partially neglected by the RL community, are central to the control community which has been widely investigating them. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is one of the most successful control techniques because, among others, of its ability to provide such guarantees even for uncertain constrained systems. Since MPC is an optimization-based technique, optimality has also often been claimed. Unfortunately, the performance of MPC is highly dependent on the accuracy of the model used for predictions. In this paper, we propose to combine RL and MPC in order to exploit the advantages of both and, therefore, obtain a controller which is optimal and safe. We illustrate the results with a numerical example in simulations.},

abstract = {The dynamics of each link and joint of a robot is characterized by a set of 14 standard dynamic parameters (6 for the inertia matrix, 3 for the centre of mass coordinates, 1 for the mass and 4 for the drive chain inertia and friction). It is known that only a subset of the standard parameters, called the base parameters, are identifiable using the inverse dynamic model and the linear least squares techniques. Moreover, some of the base parameters are poorly identified because they poorly affect the joint torque. Thus they can be eliminated, leading to a new subset of dynamic parameters called the essential parameters. However, the identified values of the base or the essential parameters may be physically inconsistent regarding to the loss of the positive definiteness of the robot inertia matrix. Several methods have been developed in the past to verify the physical consistency of the identified parameters but they are complicated, time consuming and lead to non-optimal parameters. To overcome these drawbacks, a new method calculates a set of optimal standard dynamic parameters which are the closest to a priori consistent dynamic parameters obtained through CAD data given by the robot manufacturers. This is a straightforward method which is based on using the SVD and the Cholesky factorization and the linear least squares techniques. The new procedure is experimentally validated on an industrial 6 degrees of freedom Stäubli TX-40 robot.},

abstract = {Optimization algorithms and Monte Carlo sampling algorithms have provided the computational foundations for the rapid growth in applications of statistical machine learning in recent years. There is, however, limited theoretical understanding of the relationships between these 2 kinds of methodology, and limited understanding of relative strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, existing results have been obtained primarily in the setting of convex functions (for optimization) and log-concave functions (for sampling). In this setting, where local properties determine global properties, optimization algorithms are unsurprisingly more efficient computationally than sampling algorithms. We instead examine a class of nonconvex objective functions that arise in mixture modeling and multistable systems. In this nonconvex setting, we find that the computational complexity of sampling algorithms scales linearly with the model dimension while that of optimization algorithms scales exponentially.},

This reformulation significantly reduces the dimension of the original problem, essentially to a set of lower dimensional multi-parametric programs, which are sequentially solved. Furthermore, the use of sensitivity analysis circumvents non-convexities that naturally arise in constrained dynamic programming problems.

abstract = {This paper uses optimal control to simultaneously optimize the motion and morphology of a realistic model of a 2D Monoped. In particular, we compare the energetics of four different actuator configurations: a parallel elastic actuator (PEA) in the hip and a series elastic actuator in the leg (SEA), series hip and parallel leg, series hip and series leg, and parallel hip and parallel leg. We use realistic models with mass in the legs and feet, damping in the springs, and detailed DC electric motor models. The comparison is carried out for the cost of transport of three energetic measures: positive motor work, electrical losses, and positive electrical work, and evaluated as a function of velocity. In our optimization we include motor parameters, stiffness, and spring pre-compression terms as free variables, ensuring that we compare the energetically optimal version of each configuration at each velocity. We show that for the positive motor work and the electrical losses costs of transport (COT), the parallel hip and series leg configuration is energetically optimal. For the electrical work, the optimal configuration is speed dependent, with series hip and parallel leg optimal at low speeds, and both series hip series leg and parallel hip series leg optimal at high speeds.},

@article{Ronsse2008,
abstract = {This paper investigates how the efficiency and robustness of a skilled rhythmic task compete against each other in the control of a bimanual movement. Human subjects juggled a puck in 2D through impacts with two metallic arms, requiring rhythmic bimanual actuation. The arms kinematics were only constrained by the position, velocity and time of impacts while the rest of the trajectory did not influence the movement of the puck. In order to expose the task robustness, we manipulated the task context in two distinct manners: the task tempo was assigned at four different values (hence manipulating the time available to plan and execute each impact movement individually); and vision was withdrawn during half of the trials (hence reducing the sensory inflows). We show that when the tempo was fast, the actuation was rhythmic (no pause in the trajectory) while at slow tempo, the actuation was discrete (with pause intervals between individual movements). Moreover, the withdrawal of visual information encouraged the rhythmic behavior at the four tested tempi. The discrete versus rhythmic behavior give different answers to the efficiency/robustness trade-off: discrete movements result in energy efficient movements, while rhythmic movements impact the puck with negative acceleration, a property preserving robustness. Moreover, we report that in all conditions the impact velocity of the arms was negatively correlated with the energy of the puck. This correlation tended to stabilize the task and was influenced by vision, revealing again different control strategies. In conclusion, this task involves different modes of control that balance efficiency and robustness, depending on the context.},

abstract = {A common approach in designing legged robots is to build fully actuated machines and control the machine dynamics entirely in software, carefully avoiding impacts and expending a lot of energy. However, these machines are outperformed by their human and animal counterparts. Animals achieve their impressive agility, efficiency, and robustness through a close integration of passive dynamics, implemented through mechanical components, and neural control. Robots can benefit from this same integrated approach, but a strong theoretical framework is required to design the passive dynamics of a machine and exploit them for control. For this framework, we use a bipedal spring-mass model, which has been shown to approximate the dynamics of human locomotion. This paper reports the first implementation of spring-mass walking on a bipedal robot. We present the use of template dynamics as a control objective exploiting the engineered passive spring-mass dynamics of the ATRIAS robot. The results highlight the benefits of combining passive dynamics with dynamics-based control and open up a library of spring-mass model-based control strategies for dynamic gait control of robots.},

Combining this technique with usual sampling-based methods gives rise to a family of new motion planners that can appropriately handle kinodynamic constraints while avoiding the complexity explosion and, to some extent, the conceptual difficulties associated with a move to the state space.},

We soften all constraints, in a way That avoids instabilities and unrealistic penetrations associated with earlier spring-damper methods and yet is sufficient To allow inversion. Constraints are imposed via impulses, using an extended version of The velocity-stepping approach. For holomonic constraints The extension involves a soft version of The Gauss principle. For all other constraints we extend our earlier work on complementarity-free contact dynamics - which were already known To be invertible via an iterative solver - and develop a new formulation allowing analytical inversion.},

In this paper, we aim to answer the following question: does training the perception and control systems jointly end-to-end provide better performance than training each component separately? To this end, we develop a method that can be used to learn policies that map raw image observations directly to torques at the robot's motors. The policies are represented by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 92,000 parameters, and are trained using a partially observed guided policy search method, which transforms policy search into supervised learning, with supervision provided by a simple trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method. We evaluate our method on a range of real-world manipulation tasks that require close coordination between vision and control, such as screwing a cap onto a bottle, and present simulated comparisons to a range of prior policy search methods.},

abstract = {We present an efficient variational integrator for multibody systems. Variational integrators reformulate the equations of motion for multibody systems as discrete Euler-Lagrange (DEL) equations, transforming forward integration into a root-finding problem for the DEL equations. Variational integrators have been shown to be more robust and accurate in preserving fundamental properties of systems, such as momentum and energy, than many frequently used numerical integrators. However, state-of-the-art algorithms suffer from $O(n^3)$ complexity, which is prohibitive for articulated multibody systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, $n$, in generalized coordinates. Our key contribution is to derive a recursive algorithm that evaluates DEL equations in $O(n)$, which scales up well for complex multibody systems such as humanoid robots. Inspired by recursive Newton-Euler algorithm, our key insight is to formulate DEL equation individually for each body rather than for the entire system. Furthermore, we introduce a new quasi-Newton method that exploits the impulse-based dynamics algorithm, which is also $O(n)$, to avoid the expensive Jacobian inversion in solving DEL equations. We demonstrate scalability and efficiency, as well as extensibility to holonomic constraints through several case studies.},

abstract = {We have calculated the intrinsic dimensionality of visual object representations in anterior inferotemporal (AIT) cortex, based on responses of a large sample of cells stimulated with photographs of diverse objects. As dimensionality was dependent on data set size, we determined asymptotic dimensionality as both the number of neurons and number of stimulus image approached infinity. Our final dimensionality estimate was 93 (SD: ± 11), indicating that there is basis set of approximately a hundred independent features that characterize the dimensions of neural object space. We believe this is the first estimate of the dimensionality of neural visual representations based on single-cell neurophysiological data. The dimensionality of AIT object representations was much lower than the dimensionality of the stimuli. We suggest that there may be a gradual reduction in the dimensionality of object representations in neural populations going from retina to inferotemporal cortex, as receptive fields become increasingly complex.

We derive a min–max differential inequality describing the support function of positive robust forward invariant tubes, which can be used to construct a variety of tube-based model predictive controllers. These constructions are conservative, but computationally tractable and their complexity scales linearly with the length of the prediction horizon. In contrast to many existing tube-based MPC implementations, the proposed framework does not involve discretizing the control policy and, therefore, the conservatism of the predicted tube depends solely on the accuracy of the set parameterization. The proposed approach is then used to construct a robust MPC scheme based on tubes with ellipsoidal cross-sections. This ellipsoidal MPC scheme is based on solving an optimal control problem under linear matrix inequality constraints. We illustrate these results with the numerical case study of a spring–mass–damper system.},

abstract = {Identification results dramatically depend on the excitation properties of the motion used to sample the identification model. Strategies to define persistent exciting trajectories have been developed for manipulator robots with few DOF. However they can not easily be extended to humanoid systems and humans due to the important number of DOF; and empirical knowledge is often used to generate and select persistent exciting motions. In this paper we propose a method to choose persistent exciting motions from an existing dataset in order to optimize both the identification results and the computation time. This method is based on the use of the identification model of legged systems obtained from the base-link equations. Instead of using well-established consideration on the condition number of the regressor matrix, the method uses a decomposition of the regressor into elementary sub-regressors and the computation of the condition number for each. A selection rule is then proposed. The overall method is experimentally tested to identify the human body inertial parameters using a data-set of 40 motions. Comparative results obtained from different combinations of motions are given.},

abstract = {We present a reduced-order approach for robust, dynamic, and efficient bipedal locomotion control, culminating in 3D balancing and walking with ATRIAS, a heavily underactuated legged robot. These results are a development toward solving a number of enduring challenges in bipedal locomotion: achieving robust 3D gaits at various speeds and transitioning between them, all while minimally draining on-board energy supplies. Our reduced-order control methodology works by extracting and exploiting general dynamical behaviors from the spring-mass model of bipedal walking. When implemented on a robot with spring-mass passive dynamics, e.g. ATRIAS, this controller is sufficiently robust to balance while subjected to pushes, kicks, and successive dodgeball strikes. The controller further allowed smooth transitions between stepping in place and walking at a variety of speeds (up to 1.2 m/s). The resulting gait dynamics also match qualitatively to the reduced-order model, and additionally, measurements of human walking. We argue that the presented locomotion performance is compelling evidence of the effectiveness of the presented approach; both the control concepts and the practice of building robots with passive dynamics to accommodate them},

abstract = {Interpretation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) training as an optimal control problem with nonlinear dynamical systems has received considerable attention recently, yet the algorithmic development remains relatively limited. In this work, we make an attempt along this line by reformulating the training procedure from the trajectory optimization perspective. We first show that most widely-used algorithms for training DNNs can be linked to the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), a celebrated second-order trajectory optimization algorithm rooted in the Approximate Dynamic Programming. In this vein, we propose a new variant of DDP that can accept batch optimization for training feedforward networks, while integrating naturally with the recent progress in curvature approximation. The resulting algorithm features layer-wise feedback policies which improve convergence rate and reduce sensitivity to hyper-parameter over existing methods. We show that the algorithm is competitive against state-ofthe-art first and second order methods. Our work opens up new avenues for principled algorithmic design built upon the optimal control theory.},

abstract = {A computationally efficient solution of the body-wrench distribution problem for bipeds and multi-legged robots is introduced. The method is based on a weighted generalized inverse, the weights being determined from relationships pertinent to the divergent component of motion (DCM), base-of-support (BoS) geometry, friction constraints and center of pressure allocation. The user (or the robot) specifies appropriate weights only indirectly, by setting the desired contact transition boundaries within the net BoS. It is shown that the proposed weighted generalized inverse ensures body-wrench distribution in a way consistent with both the static and dynamic states. The dependency on the DCM yields an important advantage when the method is applied to reactive balance control in response to unknown disturbances. An admittance-type stabilizer is obtained by setting the reference DCM at the current center of mass position. This stabilizer does not require reference values for the centers of pressures and the contact wrenches. The method is implemented with a whole-body, torque-based balance controller. Its performance is examined through simulations with planar and non-coplanar contacts, during proactive and reactive tasks. ARTICLE HISTORY},

abstract = {We propose a formulation of the finite horizon optimal control problem (FHOCP) based on inverse dynamics for general open-chain rigid-body systems, which reduces the computational cost from the conventional formulation based on forward dynamics. We regard the generalized acceleration as a decision variable and inverse dynamics as an equality constraint. To treat under-actuated systems with inverse dynamics that are well defined only to fully actuated systems, that is, to consider passive joints in this FHOCP, we add an equality constraint to zero the corresponding generalized torques. We include the contact forces in the decision variables of this FHOCP and treat the contact constraints using Baumgarte's stabilization method for numerical stability. We derive the optimality conditions and formulate the two-point boundary-value problem that can be efficiently solved using the recursive Newton–Euler algorithm (RNEA) and the partial derivatives of RNEA. We conducted three numerical experiments on model predictive control based on the proposed formulation to demonstrate its effectiveness. The first experiment involved simulating a swing-up control of a four-link arm with a passive joint and showed that the proposed formulation is effective for under-actuated systems. The second one involved comparing the proposed formulation with the conventional forward-dynamics-based formulation with various numbers of joints and showed that the proposed formulation reduces computational cost regardless of the number of joints. The third experiment involved simulating a whole-body control of a quadruped robot, a floating-base system having four contacts with the ground, and showed that the proposed formulation is applicable even for floating-base systems with contacts.},

Abstract Reinforcement learning offers a promising methodology for devel-oping skills for simulated characters, but typically requires work-ing with sparse hand-crafted features. Building on recent progress in deep reinforcement learning (DeepRL), we introduce a mix-ture of actor-critic experts (MACE) approach that learns terrain-adaptive dynamic locomotion skills using high-dimensional state and terrain descriptions as input, and parameterized leaps or steps as output actions. MACE learns more quickly than a single actor-critic approach and results in actor-critic experts that exhibit spe-cialization. Additional elements of our solution that contribute towards efficient learning include Boltzmann exploration and the use of initial actor biases to encourage specialization. Results are demonstrated for multiple planar characters and terrain classes.},

abstract = {In the past ten years many Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) algorithms have been developed for systems subject to stochastic disturbances and model uncertainties. These methods are motivated by many application fields where a-priori knowledge of the stochastic distribution of the uncertainties is available, some degree of constraint violation is allowed, and nominal operation should be defined as close as possible to the operational constraints for economic/optimality reasons. However, despite the large number of methods nowadays available, a general framework has not been proposed yet to classify the available alternatives. For these reasons, in this paper the main ideas underlying SMPC are first presented and different classifications of the available methods are proposed in terms of the dynamic characteristics of the system under control, the performance index to be minimized, the meaning and management of the probabilistic (chance) constraints adopted, and their feasibility and convergence properties. Focus is placed on methods developed for linear systems. In the first part of the paper, all these issues are considered, also with the help of a simple worked example. Then, in the second part, four algorithms representative of the most popular approaches to SMPC are briefly described and their main characteristics are discussed.},

In this method, the DCM trajectory is generated, consistent with the predefined footprints. Furthermore, a swing foot trajectory modification strategy is proposed to adapt the landing point, using DCM measurement. In order to apply the generated trajectories to the full robot, a Hierarchical Inverse Dynamics (HID) is employed. The HID enables us to use different combinations of the DCM tracking and step adjustment for stabilizing different biped robots. Simulation experiments on two scenarios for two different simulated robots, one with active ankles and the other with passive ankles, are carried out. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for robots with both active and passive ankles.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel stochastic Model Predictive Control algorithm for linear systems characterized by multiplicative and possibly unbounded model uncertainty. Probabilistic constraints on the states and inputs are considered, and a quadratic cost function is minimized. The stochastic control problem, and in particular the probabilistic constraints, are reformulated in deterministic terms by means of the Cantelli inequality, so that the on-line computational burden of the algorithm is similar to the one of a standard MPC method. The properties of the algorithm, namely the recursive feasibility and the pointwise convergence of the state, are proven by suitably selecting the terminal cost and the constraints on the mean and the variance of the state at the end of the prediction horizon, and by considering as additional optimization variables also the mean and the covariance of the state at the beginning of the prediction horizon. An extension to deal with the case of expectation, rather than probabilistic, constraints is reported. The numerical issues related to the off-line selection of the algorithm's parameters and its on-line implementation are discussed. Simulation results referred to a system with unbounded uncertainty are shown to compare the performances achievable with probabilistic and expectation constraints.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a new control strategy to reduce the damage to a humanoid robot during a fall. Instead of following the traditional approach of finding a favorable configuration with which to fall to the ground, this method attempts to stop the robot from falling all the way to the ground. This prevents the full transfer of the robot's potential energy to kinetic energy, and consequently results in a milder impact. The controlled motion of the falling robot involves a sequence of three deliberate contacts to the ground with the swing foot and two hands, in that order. In the final configuration the robot's center of mass (CoM) remains relatively high from the floor and the robot has a relatively stable three-point contact with the ground; hence the name tripod fall. The optimal location of the three contacts are learned through reinforcement learning algorithm. The controller is simulated on a full size humanoid, and experimentally tested on the NAO humanoid robot. In this work we apply our fall controller only to a forward fall.},

abstract = {We explore learning-based approaches for feedback control of a dexterous five-finger hand performing non-prehensile manipulation. First, we learn local controllers that are able to perform the task starting at a predefined initial state. These controllers are constructed using trajectory optimization with respect to locally-linear time-varying models learned directly from sensor data. In some cases, we initialize the optimizer with human demonstrations collected via teleoperation in a virtual environment. We demonstrate that such controllers can perform the task robustly, both in simulation and on the physical platform, for a limited range of initial conditions around the trained starting state. We then consider two interpolation methods for generalizing to a wider range of initial conditions: deep learning, and nearest neighbors. We find that nearest neighbors achieve higher performance. Nevertheless, the neural network has its advantages: it uses only tactile and proprioceptive feedback but no visual feedback about the object (i.e. it performs the task blind) and learns a time-invariant policy. In contrast, the nearest neighbors method switches between time-varying local controllers based on the proximity of initial object states sensed via motion capture. While both generalization methods leave room for improvement, our work shows that (i) local trajectory-based controllers for complex non-prehensile manipulation tasks can be constructed from surprisingly small amounts of training data, and (ii) collections of such controllers can be interpolated to form more global controllers.

abstract = {Differential dynamic programming (DDP) is a widely used trajectory optimization technique that addresses nonlinear optimal control problems, and can readily handle nonlinear cost functions. However, it does not handle either state or control constraints. This paper presents a novel formulation of DDP that is able to accommodate arbitrary nonlinear inequality constraints on both state and control. The main insight in standard DDP is that a quadratic approximation of the value function can be derived using a recursive backward pass, however the recursive formulae are only valid for unconstrained problems. The main technical contribution of the presented method is a derivation of the recursive quadratic approximation formula in the presence of nonlinear constraints, after a set of active constraints has been identified at each point in time. This formula is used in a new Constrained-DDP (CDDP) algorithm that iteratively determines these active set and is guaranteed to converge toward a local minimum. CDDP is demonstrated on several underactuated optimal control problems up to 12D with obstacle avoidance and control constraints and is shown to outperform other methods for accommodating constraints.},

Being free from the burden of the active-set methods, it can handle nonlinear state and input inequality constraints without a discernible increase in its computational complexity relative to the unconstrained case.

abstract = {We present a fixed time-step algorithm for the simulation of multi-rigid-body dynamics with joints, contact, collision, and friction. The method solves a linear complementarity problem (LCP) at each step. We show that the algorithm can be obtained as the stiff limit of fixed time-step schemes applied to regularized contact models. We do not perform collision detection. Instead, a noninterpenetration constraint is replaced by its linearization, which, together with a judicious choice of the active constraints, guarantees geometrical constraint stabilization without the need to perform a reduction of the time step to detect new collision or stick-slip transition events. Partially elastic collisions are accommodated by a suitable modification of the free term of the LCP.},

abstract = {The dynamic feasibility of solutions to motion planning problems using Rapidly Exploring Random Trees depends strongly on the choice of the distance metric used while planning. The ideal distance metric is the optimal cost of traversal between two states in the state space. However, it is computationally intensive to find the optimal cost while planning. We propose a novel approach to overcome this barrier by using a supervised learning algorithm that learns a nonlinear function which is an estimate of the optimal cost, via offline training. We use the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator approach for estimating an approximation to the optimal cost and learn this cost using Locally Weighted Projection Regression. We show that the learnt function approximates the original cost with a reasonable tolerance and more importantly, gives a tremendous speed up of a factor of 1000 over the actual computation time. We also use the learnt metric for solving the pendulum swing up planning problem and show that our metric performs better than the popularly used Linear Quadratic Regulator based metric.},

abstract = {Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy-that is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actorcritic formulation, our method achieves state-ofthe-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior onpolicy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.},

This paper describes the Toolbox of Level Set Methods, a collection of Matlab routines implementing the basic level set algorithms on fixed Cartesian grids for rectangular domains in arbitrary dimension. The Toolbox's code and interface are designed to permit flexible combinations of different schemes and PDE forms, allow easy extension through the addition of new algorithms, and achieve efficient execution despite the fact that the code is entirely written as m-files. The current contents of the Toolbox and some coding patterns important to achieving its flexibility, extensibility and efficiency are briefly explained, as is the process of adding two new algorithms.

Multi-objective test problems are constructed from single-objective optimization problems, thereby allowing known difficult features of single-objective problems (such as multi-modality, isolation, or deception) to be directly transferred to the corresponding multi-objective problem. In addition, test problems having features specific to multi-objective optimization are also constructed. More importantly, these difficult test problems will enable researchers to test their algorithms for specific aspects of multi-objective optimization.},

abstract = {Policy gradient methods are an appealing approach in reinforcement learning be-cause they directly optimize the cumulative reward and can straightforwardly be used with nonlinear function approximators such as neural networks. The two main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the diffi-culty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using value functions to substan-tially reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of the advantage function that is analogous to TD($\lambda$). We address the second challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and the value function, which are represented by neural networks. Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D locomo-tion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated robots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting out lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses hand-crafted policy repre-sentations, our neural network policies map directly from raw kinematics to joint torques. Our algorithm is fully model-free, and the amount of simulated experi-ence required for the learning tasks on 3D bipeds corresponds to 1-2 weeks of real time.},

abstract = {We investigate whether Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) is able to synthesize sophisticated and safe movement skills for a low-cost, miniature humanoid robot that can be composed into complex behavioral strategies in dynamic environments. We used Deep RL to train a humanoid robot with 20 actuated joints to play a simplified one-versus-one (1v1) soccer game. We first trained individual skills in isolation and then composed those skills end-to-end in a self-play setting. The resulting policy exhibits robust and dynamic movement skills such as rapid fall recovery, walking, turning, kicking and more; and transitions between them in a smooth, stable, and efficient manner - well beyond what is intuitively expected from the robot. The agents also developed a basic strategic understanding of the game, and learned, for instance, to anticipate ball movements and to block opponent shots. The full range of behaviors emerged from a small set of simple rewards. Our agents were trained in simulation and transferred to real robots zero-shot. We found that a combination of sufficiently high-frequency control, targeted dynamics randomization, and perturbations during training in simulation enabled good-quality transfer, despite significant unmodeled effects and variations across robot instances. Although the robots are inherently fragile, minor hardware modifications together with basic regularization of the behavior during training led the robots to learn safe and effective movements while still performing in a dynamic and agile way. Indeed, even though the agents were optimized for scoring, in experiments they walked 156% faster, took 63% less time to get up, and kicked 24% faster than a scripted baseline, while efficiently combining the skills to achieve the longer term objectives. Examples of the emergent behaviors and full 1v1 matches are available on the supplementary website.},

abstract = {Online planning of whole-body motions for legged robots is challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity in the robot dynamics. In this work, we propose a nonlinear MPC framework, the BiConMP which can generate whole body trajectories online by efficiently exploiting the structure of the robot dynamics. BiConMP is used to generate various cyclic gaits on a real quadruped robot and its performance is evaluated on different terrain, countering unforeseen pushes and transitioning online between different gaits. Further, the ability of BiConMP to generate non-trivial acyclic whole-body dynamic motions on the robot is presented. Finally, an extensive empirical analysis on the effects of planning horizon and frequency on the nonlinear MPC framework is reported and discussed.},

abstract = {. An overview is presented here of recent work and approaches to solving dynamic problems in rigid body mechanics with friction. It begins with the differential inclusion approach to Coulomb friction where the normal contact force is known. Numerical methods for these differential inclusions commonly lead to linear or nonlinear complementarity problems. Then the measure differential inclusion formulation of rigid body dynamics due to Moreau and others is presented. A novel algorithm for time-stepping for rigid body dynamics is given which avoids the "non-existence" issues that arise in many other formulations. The time-stepping algorithm requires the solution of an NCP at each step. Results on the convergence of the numerical solutions to solutions in the sense of measure differential inclusions are given, and numerical results for an implementation of the method are shown.

Using an off-the-shelf deep reinforcement learning algorithm, we trained a neural network to control a jumping quadruped robot while solely using its limbs for attitude control. We present tasks of increasing complexity leading to a combination of three-dimensional (re-)orientation and landing locomotion behaviors of a quadruped robot traversing simulated low-gravity celestial bodies. We show that our approach easily generalizes across these tasks and successfully trains policies for each case. Using sim-to-real transfer, we deploy trained policies in the real world on the SpaceBok robot placed on an experimental testbed designed for two-dimensional micro-gravity experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that repetitive, controlled jumping and landing with natural agility is possible.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling autonomous robots to learn large repertoires of behavioral skills with minimal human intervention. However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing hand-engineered policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep reinforcement learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose neural network policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively simple tasks, due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on off-policy training of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation tasks and can learn deep neural network policies efficiently enough to train on real physical robots. We demonstrate that the training times can be further reduced by parallelizing the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can learn a variety of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a complex door opening skill on real robots without any prior demonstrations or manually designed representations.},

In this paper, we present a procedure to construct time-stepping algorithms that approximate the flow of continuous ODEs for mechanical systems by discretizing Hamilton's principle rather than the equations of motion. The discrete equations share similarities to the continuous equations by preserving invariants, including the symplectic form and the momentum map. We first present a formulation of discrete mechanics along with a discrete variational principle. We then show that the resulting equations of motion preserve the symplectic form and that this formulation of mechanics leads to conservation laws from a discrete version of Noether's theorem. We then use the discrete mechanics formulation to develop a procedure for constructing symplectic-momentum mechanical integrators for Lagrangian systems with holonomic constraints. We apply the construction procedure to the rigid body and the double spherical pendulum to demonstrate numerical properties of the integrators. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Ensuring control performance with state and input constraints is facilitated by the understanding of reachable and invariant sets. While exploiting dynamical models have provided many set-based algorithms for constructing these sets, set-based methods typically do not scale well, or rely heavily on model accuracy or structure. In contrast, it is relatively simple to generate state trajectories in a data-driven manner by numerically simulating complex systems from initial conditions sampled from within an admissible state space, even if the underlying dynamics are completely unknown. These samples can then be leveraged for reachable/invariant set estimation via machine learning, although the learning performance is strongly linked to the sampling pattern. In this paper, active learning is employed to intelligently select batches of samples that are most informative and least redundant to previously labeled samples via submodular maximization. Selective sampling reduces the number of numerical simulations required for constructing the invariant set estimator, thereby enhancing scalability to higher-dimensional state spaces. The potential of the proposed framework is illustrated via a numerical example.},

abstract = {Optimal control is a widely used tool for synthesizing motions and controls for user-defined tasks under physical constraints. A common approach is to formulate it using direct multiple-shooting and then to use off-the-shelf nonlinear programming solvers that can easily handle arbitrary constraints on the controls and states. However, these methods are not fast enough for many robotics applications such as real-time humanoid motor control. Exploiting the sparse structure of optimal control problem, such as in Differential DynamicProgramming (DDP), has proven to significantly boost the computational efficiency, and recent works have been focused on handling arbitrary constraints. Despite that, DDP has been associated with poor numerical convergence, particularly when considering long time horizons. One of the main reasons is due to system instabilities and poor warm-starting (only controls). This paper presents control-limited Feasibility-driven DDP (Box-FDDP), a solver that incorporates a direct-indirect hybridization of the control-limited DDP algorithm. Concretely, the forward and backward passes handle feasibility and control limits. We showcase the impact and importance of our method on a set of challenging optimal control problems against the Box-DDP and squashing-function approach.},

abstract = {Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is considered to be a promising approach to reduce the sample complexity that hinders model-free RL. However, the theoretical understanding of such methods has been rather limited. This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework for designing and analyzing model-based RL algorithms with theoretical guarantees. We design a meta-algorithm with a theoretical guarantee of monotone improvement to a local maximum of the expected reward. The meta-algorithm iteratively builds a lower bound of the expected reward based on the estimated dynamical model and sample trajectories, and then maximizes the lower bound jointly over the policy and the model. The framework extends the optimism-in-face-of-uncertainty principle to non-linear dynamical models in a way that requires no explicit uncertainty quantification. Instantiating our framework with simplification gives a variant of model-based RL algorithms Stochastic Lower Bounds Optimization (SLBO). Experiments demonstrate that SLBO achieves state-of-the-art performance when only one million or fewer samples are permitted on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks.},

@article{Farina2016,
abstract = {In the past ten years many Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) algorithms have been developed for systems subject to stochastic disturbances and model uncertainties. These methods are motivated by many application fields where a-priori knowledge of the stochastic distribution of the uncertainties is available, some degree of constraint violation is allowed, and nominal operation should be defined as close as possible to the operational constraints for economic/optimality reasons. However, despite the large number of methods nowadays available, a general framework has not been proposed yet to classify the available alternatives. For these reasons, in this paper the main ideas underlying SMPC are first presented and different classifications of the available methods are proposed in terms of the dynamic characteristics of the system under control, the performance index to be minimized, the meaning and management of the probabilistic (chance) constraints adopted, and their feasibility and convergence properties. Focus is placed on methods developed for linear systems. In the first part of the paper, all these issues are considered, also with the help of a simple worked example. Then, in the second part, four algorithms representative of the most popular approaches to SMPC are briefly described and their main characteristics are discussed.},

abstract = {Training neural networks with verifiable robustness guarantees is challenging. Several existing approaches utilize linear relaxation based neural network output bounds under perturbation, but they can slow down training by a factor of hundreds depending on the underlying network architectures. Meanwhile, interval bound propagation (IBP) based training is efficient and significantly outperforms linear relaxation based methods on many tasks, yet it may suffer from stability issues since the bounds are much looser especially at the beginning of training. In this paper, we propose a new certified adversarial training method, CROWN-IBP, by combining the fast IBP bounds in a forward bounding pass and a tight linear relaxation based bound, CROWN, in a backward bounding pass. CROWN-IBP is computationally efficient and consistently outperforms IBP baselines on training verifiably robust neural networks. We conduct large scale experiments on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, and outperform all previous linear relaxation and bound propagation based certified defenses in $\ell_\infty$ robustness. Notably, we achieve 7.02% verified test error on MNIST at $\epsilon=0.3$, and 66.94% on CIFAR-10 with $\epsilon=8/255$. Code is available at https://github.com/deepmind/interval-bound-propagation (TensorFlow) and https://github.com/huanzhang12/CROWN-IBP (PyTorch).},

This is advantageous as already existing tools can be used to approach its solution. Our formulation is applied to the online genera-tion of trajectories for industrial robots performing pick and place operations in the presence of obstacles. Model predictive control is used in order to achieve reactive system behavior and to obtain accurate local approximations of the collision avoidance constraints (which are nonconvex). Our approach has the capacity to suppress high frequency chattering in the control signal in the presence of noise: a common drawback of aggressive control strategies. Experiment using two SCARA robots that share the same working environment is used to evaluate the presented approach.},

Model-based control has become more and more popular in the legged robots community in the last ten years. The key idea is to exploit a model of the system to compute precise motor commands that result in the desired motion. This allows to improve the quality of the motion tracking, while using lower gains, leading so to higher compliance. However, the main flaw of this approach is typically its lack of robustness to modeling errors. In this paper we focus on the robustness of inverse-dynamics control to errors in the inertial parameters of the robot. We assume these parameters to be known, but only with a certain accuracy. We then propose a computationally-efficient optimization-based controller that ensures the balance of the robot despite these uncertainties. We used the proposed controller in simulation to perform different reaching tasks with the HRP-2 humanoid robot, in the presence of various modeling errors. Comparisons against a standard inverse-dynamics controller through hundreds of simulations show the superiority of the proposed controller in ensuring the robot balance.},

The actuator model is an essential part of these works, since the optimization of energy consumption strongly depends of the accuracy of this model. Nevertheless, various authors follow very different approaches, often neglecting speed- and load-dependent losses and inertias of components such as the motor and the gearbox. Furthermore, there is no consensus on how negative power affects power consumption. Some authors calculate energy consumption by integrating the electrical power entirely, by integrating its absolute value, or by integrating only positive power. This paper assesses how well commonly used models succeed in predicting the energy consumption of an 80 W geared DC motor performing a dynamic task, by comparing the results they produce to experimental baseline measurements.},

abstract = {Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) has become a well established method for unconstrained trajectory optimization. Despite its several applications in robotics and controls however, a widely successful constrained version of the algorithm has yet to be developed. This paper builds upon penalty methods and active-set approaches, towards designing a Dynamic Programming-based methodology for constrained optimal control. Regarding the former, our derivation employs a constrained version of Bellman's principle of optimality, by introducing a set of auxiliary slack variables in the backward pass. In parallel, we show how Augmented Lagrangian methods can be naturally incorporated within DDP, by utilizing a particular set of penalty-Lagrangian functions that preserve second-order differentiability. We demonstrate experimentally that our extensions (individually and combinations thereof) enhance significantly the convergence properties of the algorithm, and outperform previous approaches on a large number of simulated scenarios.

abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have found limited success beyond simulated applications, and one main reason is the absence of safety guarantees during the learning process. Real world systems would realistically fail or break before an optimal controller can be learned. To address this issue, we propose a controller architecture that combines (1) a model-free RL-based controller with (2) model-based controllers utilizing control barrier functions (CBFs) and (3) online learning of the unknown system dynamics, in order to ensure safety during learning. Our general framework leverages the success of RL algorithms to learn high-performance controllers, while the CBF-based controllers both guarantee safety and guide the learning process by constraining the set of explorable polices. We utilize Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the system dynamics and its uncertainties. Our novel controller synthesis algorithm, RL-CBF, guarantees safety with high probability during the learning process, regardless of the RL algorithm used, and demonstrates greater policy exploration efficiency. We test our algorithm on (1) control of an inverted pendulum and (2) autonomous carfollowing with wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and show that our algorithm attains much greater sample efficiency in learning than other state-of-the-art algorithms and maintains safety during the entire learning process.},

abstract = {The claim is that compositional sparsity of the underlying target function, which corresponds to the task to be learned, is the key principle underlying machine learning. Under restrictions of smoothness of the constituent functions, sparsity of the compositional target functions naturally leads to sparse deep networks that allow approximation, optimization and generalization. This is the case of CNNs, in which the known sparse graph of the target function is reflected in the architecture of the network. It is a reasonable conjecture that transformers are able to implement a flexible version of sparsity (selecting which input tokens interact in the MLP layer), through the self-attention layers, when the target function is unknown. Surprisingly, the assumption of compositional sparsity of the target function is not restrictive in practice, since for computable functions with Lipschitz continuous derivatives compositional sparsity is equivalent to efficient computability, that is computability in polynomial time.},

abstract = {Many safety-critical applications of neural networks, such as robotic control, require safety guarantees. This article introduces a method for ensuring the safety of learned models for control using differentiable control barrier functions (dCBFs). dCBFs are end-to-end trainable and guarantee safety. They improve over classical control barrier functions (CBFs), which are usually overly conservative. Our dCBF solution relaxes the CBF definitions by: 1) using environmental dependencies; 2) embedding them into differentiable quadratic programs. These novel safety layers are called a BarrierNet. They can be used in conjunction with any neural network-based controller. They are trained by gradient descent. With BarrierNet, the safety constraints of a neural controller become adaptable to changing environments. We evaluate BarrierNet on the following several problems: 1) robot traffic merging; 2) robot navigation in 2-D and 3-D spaces; 3) end-to-end vision-based autonomous driving in a sim-to-real environment and in physical experiments; 4) demonstrate their effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

Understanding the analogy between these two sheds light on their interconnection and may lead to a number of new results. For instance, in this paper, we provide estimates of the rate of convergence when analyzing asymptotic stability of differential equations, rather than just ascertain the very fact of stability. Also, standard methods for the design of Lyapunov functions (e.g., those having the meaning of the full energy of the system) turn out to be unsatisfactory from this point of view and have to be modified. These claims are exemplified in the paper by considering the heavy-ball method for function minimization “in parallel” with the problem of asymptotic stability for the synchronous motor equation.},

abstract = {Control barrier functions have shown great success in addressing control problems with safety guarantees. These methods usually find the next safe control input by solving an online quadratic programming problem. However, model uncertainty is a big challenge in synthesizing controllers. This may lead to the generation of unsafe control actions, resulting in severe consequences. In this paper, we develop a learning framework to deal with system uncertainty. Our method mainly focuses on learning the dynamics of the control barrier function, especially for high relative degree with respect to a system. We show that for each order, the time derivative of the control barrier function can be separated into the time derivative of the nominal control barrier function and a remainder. This implies that we can use a neural network to learn the remainder so that we can approximate the dynamics of the real control barrier function. We show by simulation that our method can generate safe trajectories under parametric uncertainty using a differential drive robot model.},

abstract = {Inspired by the success of imitation and inverse reinforcement learning in replicating expert behavior through optimal control, we propose a learning based approach to safe controller synthesis based on control barrier functions (CBFs). We consider the setting of a known nonlinear control affine dynamical system and assume that we have access to safe trajectories generated by an expert - a practical example of such a setting would be a kinematic model of a self-driving vehicle with safe trajectories (e.g., trajectories that avoid collisions with obstacles in the environment) generated by a human driver. We then propose and analyze an optimization based approach to learning a CBF that enjoys provable safety guarantees under suitable Lipschitz smoothness assumptions on the underlying dynamical system. A strength of our approach is that it is agnostic to the parameterization used to represent the CBF, assuming only that the Lipschitz constant of such functions can be efficiently bounded. Furthermore, if the CBF parameterization is convex, then under mild assumptions, so is our learning process. We end with extensive numerical evaluations of our results on both planar and realistic examples, using both random feature and deep neural network parameterizations of the CBF. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results that learn provably safe control barrier functions from data.},

abstract = {Safety constraints and optimality are important but sometimes conflicting criteria for controllers. Although these criteria are often solved separately with different tools to maintain formal guarantees, it is also common practice in reinforcement learning to simply modify reward functions by penalizing failures, with the penalty treated as a mere heuristic. We rigorously examine the relationship of both safety and optimality to penalties, and formalize sufficient conditions for <italic>safe value functions</italic>: value functions that are both optimal for a given task, and enforce safety constraints. We reveal this structure by examining when rewards preserve viability under optimal control, and show that there always exists a finite penalty that induces a safe value function. This penalty is not unique, but upper-unbounded: larger penalties do not harm optimality. Although it is often not possible to compute the minimum required penalty, we reveal clear structure of how the penalty, rewards, discount factor, and dynamics interact. This insight suggests practical, theory-guided heuristics to design reward functions for control problems where safety is important.},

abstract = {Reach-avoid optimal control problems, in which the system must reach certain goal conditions while staying clear of unacceptable failure modes, are central to safety and liveness assurance for autonomous robotic systems, but their exact solutions are intractable for complex dynamics and environments. Recent successes in the use of reinforcement learning methods to approximately solve optimal control problems with performance objectives make their application to certification problems attractive; however, the Lagrange-type objective (cumulative costs or rewards over time) used in reinforcement learning is not suitable to encode temporal logic requirements. Recent work has shown promise in extending the reinforcement learning machinery to safety-type problems, whose objective is not a sum, but a minimum (or maximum) over time. In this work, we generalize the reinforcement learning formulation to handle all optimal control problems in the reach-avoid category. We derive a time-discounted reach-avoid Bellman backup with contraction mapping properties and prove that the resulting reach-avoid Q-learning algorithm converges under analogous conditions to the traditional Lagrange-type problem, yielding an arbitrarily tight conservative approximation to the reach-avoid set. We further demonstrate the use of this formulation with deep reinforcement learning methods, retaining zero-violation guarantees by treating the approximate solutions as untrusted oracles in a model-predictive supervisory control framework. We evaluate our proposed framework on a range of nonlinear systems, validating the results against analytic and numerical solutions, and through Monte Carlo simulation in previously intractable problems. Our results open the door to a range of learning-based methods for safe-and-live autonomous behavior, with applications across robotics and automation.},

In this review, we begin by briefly presenting background on reachability analysis with an emphasis on the HJ formulation. We then present recent work showing how high-dimensional reachability verification can be made more tractable by focusing on two areas of development: system decomposition for general nonlinear systems, and traffic protocols for unmanned airspace management. By tackling the curse of dimensionality, tractable verification of practical systems is becoming a reality, paving the way for more pervasive and safer automation.},

abstract = {Safety is often the most important requirement in robotics applications. Nonetheless, control techniques that can provide safety guarantees are still extremely rare for nonlinear systems, such as robot manipulators. A well-known tool to ensure safety is the Viability kernel, which is the largest set of states from which safety can be ensured. Unfortunately, computing such a set for a nonlinear system is extremely challenging in general. Several numerical algorithms for approximating it have been proposed in the literature, but they suffer from the curse of dimensionality. This paper presents a new approach for numerically approximating the viability kernel of robot manipulators. Our approach solves optimal control problems to compute states that are guaranteed to be on the boundary of the set. This allows us to learn directly the set boundary, therefore learning in a smaller dimensional space. Compared to the state of the art on systems up to dimension 6, our algorithm resulted to be more than 2 times as accurate for the same computation time, or 6 times as fast to reach the same accuracy.},

@article{Boffi2020a,
abstract = {Many existing tools in nonlinear control theory for establishing stability or safety of a dynamical system can be distilled to the construction of a certificate function that guarantees a desired property. However, algorithms for synthesizing certificate functions typically require a closed-form analytical expression of the underlying dynamics, which rules out their use on many modern robotic platforms. To circumvent this issue, we develop algorithms for learning certificate functions only from trajectory data. We establish bounds on the generalization error - the probability that a certificate will not certify a new, unseen trajectory - when learning from trajectories, and we convert such generalization error bounds into global stability guarantees. We demonstrate empirically that certificates for complex dynamics can be efficiently learned, and that the learned certificates can be used for downstream tasks such as adaptive control.},

@article{Zhang2021,
abstract = {Safety is a critical property in applications including robotics, transportation, and energy. Safety is especially challenging in reinforcement learning (RL) settings, in which uncertainty of the system dynamics may cause safety violations during exploration. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), which enforce safety by constraining the control actions at each time step, are a promising approach for safety-critical control. This technique has been applied to ensure the safety of model-free RL, however, it has not been integrated into model-based RL. In this paper, we propose Uncertainty-Tolerant Control Barrier Functions (UTCBFs), a new class of CBFs to incorporate model uncertainty and provide provable safety guarantees with desired probability. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm for model-based RL to guarantee safety by integrating CBFs with gradient-based policy search. Our approach is verified through a numerical study of a cart-pole system and an inverted pendulum system with comparison to state-of-the-art RL algorithms.},

@inproceedings{Sun2021a,
abstract = {This paper investigates reinforcement learning with constraints, which are indispensable in safety-critical environments. To drive the constraint violation to decrease monotonically, we take the constraints as Lyapunov functions and impose new linear constraints on the policy parameters' updating dynamics. As a result, the original safety set can be forward-invariant. However, because the new guaranteed-feasible constraints are imposed on the updating dynamics instead of the original policy parameters, classic optimization algorithms are no longer applicable. To address this, we propose to learn a generic deep neural network (DNN)-based optimizer to optimize the objective while satisfying the linear constraints. The constraint-satisfaction is achieved via projection onto a polytope formulated by multiple linear inequality constraints, which can be solved analytically with our newly designed metric. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DNN-based optimizer for constrained optimization with the forward invariance guarantee. We show that our optimizer trains a policy to decrease the constraint violation and maximize the cumulative reward monotonically. Results on numerical constrained optimization and obstacle-avoidance navigation validate the theoretical findings.},
annote = {Not very interesting. Use a CBF-like condition on the weights update rule of the NN to ensure that eventually the policy satisfies the constraints. To ensure this condition is satisfied they project the gradient on the constraint set (which is a polytope), and use an LSTM network to generate the pre-projection gradients (not clear how this LSTM network is trained).},
